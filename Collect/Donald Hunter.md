# Blog posts by Donald Hunter

These blogs are mastered in GitHub and written in org-mode so it should be relatively easy for
me to remaster them to Raku, assuming working dependencies. A couple already refer to Raku but
still use a Perl 6 shebang so I included them here.

I'm not sure if the *conserve* step is necessary given that the blogs are in GitHub.
