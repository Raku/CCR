As I (raiph) write this, the current post for the above URL, titled "Contributing to Raku", and dated Mar 20, 2024, looks bogus -- as if it's written by a bot that's taken over the blog. Having looked at older posts I see that the author name has been changed from what it was originally, but the content seems otherwise identical to what I recall from reading it in 2019.

So several things seem plausible, ranging from me being completely wrong to think anything is amiss, to this blog having indeed been taken over by a bot, so the content is presumably at risk of disappearing at any moment, and thus this stuff should be conserved, and the author name also perhaps not being legit, so it should be remastered under the old name.
