  <p><em>(This blog post is part three of a series; there's also a <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/dash-n-and-dash-p">part one</a> and a <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/dash-n-and-dash-p-part-two">part two</a>.)</em></p>

<p>Shortly after I wrote the <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/dash-n-and-dash-p-part-two">last post</a> on <code>-n</code> and <code>-p</code>, and how I didn't really understand what a setting was in Perl 6, sorear++ and TimToady++ filled me in on all of the details. So here I am, a third time, to pass the knowledge on.</p>

<p>I wrote last time that I found the term "setting" confusing and overloaded. That's because I thought it was a single, defined thing. In effect, there's no <em>the</em> setting in Perl 6; there can be many at the same time.</p>

<p>A setting is simply something that surrounds your code on the outside. (Haskell has a <a href="http://haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html">Prelude</a>, but a prelude only comes before your code. A setting envelopes your code both before and after.) Your code simply finds itself lexically inside some setting or other. In technical parlance, whatever is the <code>OUTER::</code> of your code is a setting.</p>

<p>So, you <em>can</em> have several settings, just like I wished for. They stack, you see. Or rather <em>peel</em>, like onion layers. One man's setting is another man's code, all the way outwards into the final <code>OUTER::</code> nothingness of empty space.</p>

<p>And &mdash; the final piece of the puzzle &mdash; the big default "here, friend, are all of your builtins" setting is called <code>CORE</code>. I'd always wondered why we keep saying both "setting" and <code>CORE</code>. (And why Rakudo calls the directory <code>src/core</code>, not <code>src/setting</code>.) That's why; <code>CORE</code> is just a setting among others.</p>

<p>The discussion &mdash; which consists mostly of sorear and TimToady telling how things really are &mdash; can be found <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2011-09-05#i_4376926">here</a>.</p>

<p>And now I think I'm finally done writing on how <code>-n</code> and <code>-p</code> work. 哈哈</p>
