  </header>

  <p><em>(This blog post is part two of a series; there's also a <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/dash-n-and-dash-p">part one</a> and a <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/dash-n-and-dash-p-part-three">part three</a>.)</em></p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/dash-n-and-dash-p">last time</a> about how <code>-n</code> and <code>-p</code> were implemented in a text-oriented way in Perl 5, and in an AST-oriented way in Rakudo.</p>

<p>Afterwards, TimToady said he thought I was going to write about settings and <code>{YOU_ARE_HERE}</code>. You see, the <em>spec</em> doesn't talk about toying around with ASTs, it talks about <code>-n</code> being equivalent to having a setting that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for lines() {
    {YOU_ARE_HERE}
}
</code></pre>

<p>(This is completely equivalent to the current AST approach, but with code instead; the <code>{YOU_ARE_HERE}</code> gets replaced by your program. In a way, it's a nice full circle back to a text-based way of doing things, but correctly this time. Kissing eskimos still need not apply.)</p>

<p>The whole notion confused me, because by "setting", I generally mean the set of builtins provided by Perl 6. Here it seemed to mean "a layer of code immediately surrounding your program". I <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2011-09-03#i_4366219">asked</a> on the channel. Turns out no-one else knew, either.</p>

<p>There was plenty of good discussion, though. Didn't make me any wiser, but it was at least interesting.</p>

<p>Finally jnthn suggested that maybe Rakudo actually does this right already (with the ASTs) and the spec is wrong. I can agree with that, at least to the extent that I don't see how the current setting/<code>{YOU_ARE_HERE}</code> spec is s'posed to work, but I feel pretty comfortable about those AST transformations.</p>

<p>So, um, yeah.</p>
