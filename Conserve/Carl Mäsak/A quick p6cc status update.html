  <p>The <code>p4</code> blog post is coming next week. It's the interesting one of the five, and I thought I'd give it a good bit of preparation, in the form of two blog posts about games. I hope you'll all like that.</p>

<p>In thinking about how to make the first preparatory blog post, I quickly slid into an interesting yak-shaving coding project, a bit of Perl 6 code which may make the post better... or it may not, I don't know yet. Anyway, I promise to not waste more than a few days down the yak-shaving path, and that I'll have that first post ready on Sunday, and the second one early next week.</p>

<p>In the meantime, moritz++ has written a <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/thoughts-on-p6cc.writeback">thoughtful post on the code submissions and reviews</a> so far. I'll definitely be trying my best to integrate his comments into my reviews as time permits.</p>

<p>I'm happy that all the three contestants (colomon, moritz, Util) who are active on <code>#perl6</code> have chosen to engage in discussion about the solutions even after the end of the contest. I think it's a big win for the Perl 6 community that such discussion happens. So far, I'm very happy about the ripples the Perl 6 Coding Contest has caused in Rakudo, in RT, and in the community.</p>
