  </header>

  <p>Sometimes things seem to click and fall into place inside my brain. Previously
unrelated concepts turn out to be have commonalities after all.</p>

<p>For example, I said yesterday on #perl6 that I'd realized, teaching Perl 5,
that taking away <code>wantarray</code> was only a logical next step after taking away
sigil variance. Moritz was way ahead of me, though: he had <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/immutable-sigils-and-context.html">blogged about
exactly
this</a>
a year ago.</p>

<p>But a much deeper insight hit me on the Sunday, when jnthn++ was talking, and
explaining how <code>Capture</code>s and <code>Signature</code>s form two sides of a function call
binding:</p>

<pre><code> caller                     callee

Capture &lt;---&gt; binder &lt;---&gt; Signature
</code></pre>

<p>and then showing a slide that looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>my ($some, $random, $things) := some-function();
</code></pre>

<p>The point of the slide is that <code>Signature</code>s aren't just used in function
declarations; they're used in the above case as well. I've always thought that
this was a random, fortuitous bonus use of it...</p>

<p>...but then Liz turned to me and whispered "that's because <code>return</code> is just
another function call". And right then and there, I went through some sort of
mini-enlightenment. How beautiful!</p>

<p>Later, Liz divulged that this was the kind of insight that came naturally when
one had programmed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">continuation-passing style</a>
for a while. It'd be interesting to learn whether CPS is the reason for
<code>Signature</code>s being used in bindings like this in Perl 6. For some reason, my
guess is no.</p>

<p>Anyway, Perl 6 surprising me with its consistency is only appropriate,
given the name of this blog.</p>
