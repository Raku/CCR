  </header>

  <p>Last summer I spent a month <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/a-month-of-blogging-about-programming-fundamentals">blogging about basic
programming</a>,
building stuff up out of small building blocks into bigger and bigger games.
The exercise was modeled on some books I liked when I was a teenager and
curious about programming.</p>

<p>The last game was a text adventure game. It became... big. More ambitious than
I had planned.</p>

<p>It's not that it had that many rooms or was that long. It didn't even
experience feature creep. It was just a fairly big and ambitious game. I
finished it, but more than half a month after I had planned. In retrospect, it
was insane to assume I would be able to write it in the last two days of that
month of blogging. Dedicating a whole month to writing the adventure game would
have been more appropriate.</p>

<p>So, that's what I will do. I will write <em>exactly the same game</em> over the scope
of a month. Well, functionally it will be the same. The details of the
implementation will be different. Better.</p>

<p>We will learn a lot together, dear reader. Things that got lost in a sea of
details last year.</p>

<p>What's more, there are a couple of other advantages with doing this all over
again:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There's a certain amount of artistic suffering in writing text descriptions
and coming up with a plot and all that. Since I'll be doing the same game, I
won't have to do that, I can just re-use everything from last year. Might put
in the odd improvement, of course.</p></li>
<li><p>I <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/what-i-learned-from-the-june-blogging">realized last year</a>
that I really should have written this game with Test-Driven Development. I
will this time around. Not only that, you will see the domain-oriented TDD
that I prefer nowadays, and that really should be more well-known. This
approach really makes you <em>understand</em> object orientation. At least that's
the effect it has on me.</p></li>
<li><p>In retrospect, I don't think I should have leaned so hard on type
system. I used roles a lot last year, like <code>Openable</code>. And then mixed them
into classes, like <code>Door</code>. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it
does make the whole object model a little inflexible and, well, static. This
year around I'll try something else, and I think it'll come out better and
more dynamic, while at the same time more light-weight. I think you'll like
it better.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There will be zillions of spoilers for the actual game. If <em>you</em> know a way to
give a detailed public account of how to implement an open-source adventure
game without giving away the whole plot, get in touch.</p>

<p>Until I conclude this blogging month, there will be an ongoing mini-contest
known as "Devastate The Adventure Game". Basically, you download the game and
run it on Rakudo. If at <em>any</em> point during its development you manage to get
the game to behave outside of its intended parameters, you're in the contest. I
want to hear about all instances of this, and I'll do my best to log them all
publicly. The most insane, creative, simply up-the-wall fruit-bat bananas
mis-use of the game (decided by me; any number of entries per person) wins an
Amazon book worth about 50 EUR. Crazy stunts may get honorable mentions in
the blog posts, too.</p>

<p>Suddenly this feels pretty exciting. 哈哈 Come on folks, nail the masakbot!</p>

<p>Oh, and I wrote a plan for the whole month. Subject to change, but the basic
structure is hopefully there.</p>
