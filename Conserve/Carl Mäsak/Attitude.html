  <p>Moritz seems to have an uncanny ability to get me to blog lately, with just a single line of IRC conversation. Last time it was <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/three-bugs-that-bug-me-right-now">a tongue-in-cheek suggestion</a> for how to draw attention to blocker bugs. This time it was a light-hearted but oh-so-true comment on my complaining, for the N-th time, about being <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-01-29#i_872381">blocked in various places</a>, with no-one to fix my bugs for me:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;moritz_&gt; in the old days you'd just worked around it
</code></pre>

<p>I proceeded to explain to him why these particular bugs were non-workaroundable, and he had the cheerful audacity to suggest workarounds for them. Hrm.</p>

<p>It was somewhere around then that I realised that I had lost that industrious spirit that helped us build November last summer, despite all the obstacles at that time. Dang.</p>

<p>Several thoughts have struck me since then. The expression "it is a poor workman who blames his tools" applies here; I should complain less and JFDI more. In a way, rakudobugs and their corresponding workarounds actually help code quality in our projects, because we have a very legitimate reason to return to a particular piece of code and rewrite it when the rakudobug is fixed. But for that to work, "just write a <code># RAKUDO</code> comment and move on" has to be the dominant paradigm.</p>

<p>Another is the Swedish expression "Det är inte hur man har det, utan hur man tar det". (Loosely, "Attitude trumps situation.") By which I mean, the more I complain about bugs which block me, the more it will <em>feel</em> that way, with less code being written as a result.</p>

<p>It turns out that at least bug number three in <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/three-bugs-that-bug-me-right-now">that last blog post</a> wasn't an absolute blocker by far. I managed to rewrite that code, and I believe <a href="http://github.com/masak/druid/commit/5444d9fa17a0419770899a3b4de773a0285f09ee">the end result</a> even became more readable, on top of actually working as intended. Damnit, even the saying "every obstacle is an opportunity in disguise", despite being such a clichéd cliché, applies here.</p>

<p>I haven't had much time to look at the two other bugs in the list, but it wouldn't surprise me if they, too, are more a question of having the right attitude than of anything else. If nothing else, I'll just write a <code># RAKUDO</code> comment and move on.</p>

<p>Lastly, just because I'm one of the heaviest Rakudo abusers in the world, that <em>still</em> doesn't give me the right to expect anything in terms of feature implementation speed or bug fixing speed. It's an open-source project, propelled by people who do it for their love of the Perl 6 idea, or because they secured that grant, or both. Rakudo has been coming along nicely during the last half year, but due to a combination of circumstances its core devs just haven't been available very much in January. I must learn to accept that.</p>

<p>In the end, I'm glad I realised that I'd gone from industrious workarounditude to excessive complainulexity; in the future, I'll try and re-focus on the former, because I believe that's the way I can best help the Rakudo effort along.</p>

<p>Nobody can take your mojo from you. Except perhaps yourself.</p>
