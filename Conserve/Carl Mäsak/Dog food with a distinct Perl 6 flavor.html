  <p>For a long time, I kept using <a href="http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal"><code>use Perl</code></a> for my blogging, knowing that there are better solutions out there. <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a> being among the most alluring alternatives. Various Perl 6 bloggers were also reporting happiness with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>-based blogs. Inertia kept me tied to use Perl.</p>

<p>Inertia &mdash; and something else. I had a teeny tiny dream that I could make a blogging solution in Perl 6. That would, I theorized, make me ultimately happy.</p>

<p>Except that it would never happen. It's quite a big step to move blogs, and doing it while actually <em>inventing</em> the new blog under oneself... no wai.</p>

<p>And then <code>use Perl</code> forced my hand. After ~10 years of service, it has now been <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=10/09/08/2053239">shut down</a>. And suddenly, I found myself without a blogging platform.</p>

<p>So I thought, what the heck.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks later, here I stand with a working blogging solution in Perl 6. Yay!</p>

<p>I'll have a lot more to say about the blogging software as we go along, but here are the main points in bullet form:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's written in Perl 6. (See above.)</li>
<li>It's currently 200 <em>lines</em> of Perl 6!</li>
<li>It's a static website generator. (If it weren't for today's speed limitations, it'd probably generate pages dynamically. There is, after all, <a href="http://november-wiki.org/">a wiki engine</a> that pulled that off already two years ago.)</li>
<li>It outsources Markdown generation to Perl 5. This may or may not be a temporary solution.</li>
<li>I'm not ready to put it on github yet, but <a href="http://gist.github.com/601864">here's a snapshot of the source</a> if you're interested.</li>
<li>There's a static website generator called Hakyll on which I'm basing the general design of my program. Over time, I hope to push things out into what will eventually become a port of Hakyll. I want to do this while continually running the blog, to make sure things keep working. (Hence the title of this post.)</li>
<li>A friend tweeted that it'd be funny if there were a Java port of Hakyll <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">called Jyde</a>. On the spot, I decided that the Perl 6 port should be called Psyde. So that's what it'll be called.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary: yay, new blog! Watch this space.</p>
