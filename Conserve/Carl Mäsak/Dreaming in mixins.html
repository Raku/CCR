  <p>Working with pls (a next-gen project installer for the Perl 6 ecosystem), I had a few classes with code like this:</p>

<pre><code>class POC::Tester does App::Pls::Tester {
    method test($project --&gt; Result) {
        my $target-dir = "cache/$project&lt;name&gt;";
        if "$target-dir/Makefile" !~~ :e {
            return failure;
        }
        unless run-logged( relative-to($target-dir, "make test"),
                           :step('test'), :$project ) {
            return failure;
        }

        return success;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>success</code> and <code>failure</code> are <code>Result</code> enum values defined elsewhere. They felt like pleasant documentation, and when return type checking works, they'll even help catch errors!)</p>

<p>Now, I wanted to add super-simple progress diagnostics to this method. I wanted an <code>announce-start-of('test', $project);</code> at the start of the module, and either an <code>announce-end-of('test', success);</code> or an <code>announce-end-of('test', failure);</code>, depending on the success or failure of the method.</p>

<p>I have a low threshold for boilerplate. After realizing that I'd have to manually add those calls in the beginning of the method, and before each <code>return</code> — and not only in this method, but in several others — I thought "man, I shouldn't have to tolerate this. This is Perl 6, it should be able to do better!"</p>

<p>So I thought about what I really wanted to do. I wanted some sort of... method wrapper. Didn't really want a subclass, and a regular role wouldn't cut it (because class methods override same-named role methods).</p>

<p>Then it struck me: <em>mixins</em>. Did those already work in Rakudo? Oh well, try it and see. So I created this role:</p>

<pre><code>role POC::TestAnnouncer {
    method test($project --&gt; Result) {
        announce-start-of('test', $project&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;);
        my $result = callsame;
        announce-end-of('test', $result);
        return $result;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then, later:</p>

<pre><code>POC::Tester.new() does POC::TestAnnouncer
</code></pre>

<p>And it worked! On the first attempt! jnthn++!</p>

<p>(If you're wondering what in the above method that does the wrapping — it's the <code>callsame</code> call in the middle. It delegates back to the overridden method. Note that with this tactic, I get to write my <code>announce-start-of</code> and <code>announce-end-of</code> calls <em>exactly once</em>. I don't have to go hunting for all the various places in the original code where a <code>return</code> is made.)</p>

<p>I guess this counts as using mixins to do Aspect-Oriented Programming. This way of working certainly makes the code less <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming#Motivation_and_basic_concepts">scattered and tangled</a>.</p>

<p>So, in <a href="http://github.com/masak/proto/blob/4396d9b6c6eca4c9a0d1e9da7ac90903c4ea528c/proof-of-concept">this file</a>, I currently have a veritable curry of dependency injection, behavior-adding roles, lexical subs inside methods, AOP-esque mixins, and a <code>MAIN</code> sub. They mix together to create something really tasty. And it all runs, today, under Rakudo HEAD.</p>

<p>As jnthn said earlier today, it's pretty cool that a script of 400 LoC, together with a 230-LoC module, make up a whole working installer. With so little code, it almost doesn't feel like coding.</p>
