    <h1><a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/gge-now-runs-fine-on-rakudo-master">GGE now runs fine on Rakudo master</a></h1>
  </header>

  <p>After <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/step-1-on-the-road-to-recovery-admitting-you-have-a-problem">admitting that I had a problem</a>, I decided that perhaps it would be good to take one single application and just beat it into submission, making it run on Rakudo master.</p>

<p>I chose <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge">GGE</a>. That was a mistake, but perhaps a positive one.</p>

<p>GGE is <em>big</em>, and has many tests, 750 of them. Running through them all takes almost 40 minutes. (The first "G" in GGE stands for "Glacial".) I keep thinking of GGE is "the biggest Perl 6 application out there", even though it's probably not that big, just fairly complex and well-tested. The mistake was attacking GGE first, and not something smaller.</p>

<p>The way the mistake might turn out to be a positive one is that I'll probably feel that converting other applications from alpha to master is relatively painless. 哈哈</p>

<p>Here's a summary of things to think about, if you're planning to port your Perl 6 application from alpha to master:</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rakudo master has better interpolation of things like <code>"@lol[]"</code>. I found a lot of cases where I "cheated" and used symbols which weren't magical in alpha, but which are now. Beware.</li>
<li><code>is also</code> is now <code>augment</code>, and requires <code>use MONKEY_TYPING;</code>.</li>
<li>If you had put <code>sub</code>s in your class, chances are you'll need to <code>our</code> them now.</li>
<li>Rakudo master is stricter about not changing the <em>contents</em> of readonly containers, such as arrays and hashes. You'll get a slap on the fingers if you did this.</li>
<li><code>undef</code> is gone. You probably meant <code>Nil</code> or <code>Any</code> or something.</li>
<li>If you were using <code>postcircumfix:&lt;( )&gt;</code>, remember that Rakudo master now requires the parameter list to consist of just a single Capture parameter. In practice, that means another layer of parentheses compared to alpha.</li>
<li><code>break</code> in <code>when</code> blocks is now called <code>succeed</code> (and <code>continue</code> is called <code>proceed</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Regressions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Named enums work in master, but they're not really up to spec yet. If you used them as sets of constant, things might still work. If you used methods like <code>.name</code> and <code>.pick</code>, you'll need to <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=75296">work around</a> for the time being. (And re-read the spec.)</li>
<li>The <code>&lt;-&gt;</code> syntax for pointy blocks <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=74182">is no longer implemented</a>.</li>
<li>Backslash escapes <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=73698">don't work</a> in character classes.</li>
<li><code>Str.trans</code> doesn't work.</li>
<li><a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=75386"> <code>handles</code> </a> doesn't work.</li>
<li>Using an optional hash parameter with <code>is copy</code> semantics? Well, <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=74454">it won't work</a>. Sorry.</li>
<li><code>Str.subst</code> works, but using <code>$_</code> in a closure in its second argument doesn't.</li>
<li>Sometimes you have to clone closures using <code>pir::clone</code>, or <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=73034">they won't close properly</a> around their surrounding environments.</li>
<li><code>"\e"</code> <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=75244">doesn't work</a> at the moment. Use <code>"\c[27]"</code> or <code>"\x[1b]".</code></li>
<li>If you were general before and wrote <code>List</code> rather than <code>Array</code> because, well, it's shorter and more inclusive... that won't work now. <code>Array</code> no longer subclasses <code>List</code>.</li>
<li>There are some situations when you might wind up with <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=74336">double [] in arrays.</a></li>
<li>There's something wrong with <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=74302">list assignment and hashes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It took two months of leisurely refactoring and debugging to bring GGE through the needle's eye. But I must confess that it was pretty sweet to subsequently rid it of all of alpha's workarounds. Clearly a net win.</p>
