  <p><a href="http://masak.github.io/007/">007</a>, the toy language, is turning three today. Whoa.</p>

<p>On its one-year anniversary, I wrote <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/double-oh-seven">a blog post</a> to chronicle it. It seriously doesn't feel like two years since I wrote that post.</p>

<p>On and off, in between long stretches of just being a parent, I come back to 007 and work intensely on it. I can't remember ever keeping a side project alive for three years before. (<em>Later note</em>: Referring to the language here, not my son.) So there is that.</p>

<p>So in a weird way, even though the language is not as far along as I would expect it to be after three years, I'm also positively surprised that it still <em>exists</em> and is <em>active</em> after three years!</p>

<p>In the previous blog post, I proudly announce that "We're gearing up to an (internal) v1.0.0 release". Well, we're <em>still</em> gearing up for v1.0.0, and we are closer to it. The details are in <a href="https://github.com/masak/007/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">the roadmap</a>, which has become much more detailed since then.</p>

<p>Noteworthy things that happened in these past two years:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've gone full circle, <a href="https://github.com/masak/007/issues/212#issuecomment-320449569">trying a <em>very difficult</em> thing first with strategy A, then with B, and now with A again</a>.</li>
<li>I've had to invent a new term, "injectile", for <a href="https://github.com/masak/007/issues/212#issuecomment-330138105">the bit of code a macro produces; often a copy of a quasi block</a>.</li>
<li>An issue about quasi unquotes has stalled because parsing is hard enough without differently-shaped holes, and <a href="https://github.com/masak/007/issues/30">was hijacked by very interesting discussions about syntax and whether "quasi" is a fitting name for the thing it signifies</a>.</li>
<li>I've <a href="https://github.com/masak/007/issues/30#issuecomment-331633998">understood new things about templates</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that I'm looking forward to right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Landing <code>macro infix:&lt;ff&gt;</code> in <code>master</code>, which is quite literally one small fix away at this point.</li>
<li>Landing <a href="https://github.com/masak/007/pull/242">a huge object system refactor</a> that really cleans up the language.</li>
<li><code>is parsed</code>, also only a few steps away.</li>
<li>Making a better web site, focused around language tutorials and API documentation.</li>
<li>Writing a 007 parser in pure 007.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried to write those in increasing order of difficulty.</p>

<p>All in all, I'm quite eager to one day burst into <code>#perl6</code> or <code>#perl6-dev</code> and actually showcase examples where macros quite <em>clearly</em> do useful, non-trivial things. 007 is and has always been about producing such examples, and making them run in a real (if toy) environment.</p>

<p>And while we're not quite over that hump yet, we're perceptibly closer than we were two years ago.</p>

<p><em>Belated addendum</em>: Thanks and hugs to sergot++, to vendethiel++, to raiph++ and eritain++, for sharing the journey with me so far.</p>
