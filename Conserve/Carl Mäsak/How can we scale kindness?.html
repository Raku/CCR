  <p><a href="http://www.rubyrailways.com/rails-is-still-a-ghetto/">Peter Szinek</a> and then <a href="http://hackety.org/2009/04/29/aSelectionOfThoughtsFromActualWomen.html">_why</a> each wrote a constructive blog entry about the recent Rails community <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8fsnz/rails_is_still_a_ghetto/">porn-star/professionalism discussion</a>. My purpose here is not to summarise or enter into that discussion; the interested reader may follow those links instead. I just wish to use those posts as a springboard for a similar point:</p>

<p><em>Every day, we contribute to shaping our community.</em></p>

<p>Obviously, some sort of inverse proportion (to the size of the community) is involved here too. I spend quite a lot of time thinking about this. Every day, I see the Perl 6 community scaling up, welcoming new people on <code>#perl6</code>. I see a lot of kindness and good manners. (My posts <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/barefoot">barefoot</a> and <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/how-perl-6-just-sells-itself">How Perl 6 just sells itself</a> cover this quite well.) I see — sometimes to my astonishment — typical flame-war opening remarks derail into interesting discussions of insight and mutual agreement.</p>

<p>People come into the channel asking questions. Regulars, myself included, try to answer them clearly and patiently. We even have a few newcomers who are obviously not on <code>#perl6</code> for the Perl 6. Perhaps they simply like the atmosphere; I know I do.</p>

<p>I look at all of this, and I hope it will last.</p>

<p>What can we do to make sure it does, when a critical mass is reached and people start pouring in? I don't know. <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html">Paul Graham</a> has some interesting ideas, which seem to boil down to "expect courtesy". Larry Wall recently <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/2009/05/msg31897.html">intervened</a> in an email discussion which threatened to develop trenches.</p>

<p>The Perl 6 community is not having the discussion that the Rail's community is having right now about offensiveness, manners, and a macho attitude... because we're not big enough to have that problem. I believe that the community as a whole is quite open to Perl 6 programmers of all sexes. I cannot say this with certainty, though, since my perspective is limited to that of a man's.</p>

<p>We're still small, and as we grow we have excellent opportunity to keep the community open, inclusive and accepting. How do we do that?</p>
