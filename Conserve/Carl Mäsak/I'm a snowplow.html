  <p>Oops. I think excessive distractedness just made me miss a 10-day interval, thereby falling off the Iron Man challenge. Oh well. [Sidenote: Is there a way to easily check one's Ironman status?]</p>

<p>Lately, I've been feeling a bit like the snowplows shuffling snow around outside my office window. I have a lot of things I want to blog about, but I've been pushing them ahead of me. That's exactly what the Iron Man thing is supposed to counter. Guess procrastination won out in this case.</p>

<p>So, how much blog would a masak write if a masak could write blog? Here's a list off the top of my head of the things I've been <em>thinking</em> of blogging about:</p>

<ul>
<li>The presentation I'm writing for the <a href="http://www.opensourcedays.org/2010/node/267">Open Source Days in Copenhagen</a> this weekend. I'm really excited about it.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/upcoming-the-7-wonders-of-the-ancient-perl-6-grammar-engine">"7 Wonders of the Ancient Grammar Engine"</a> series. I've started on it, and I like what I have so far.</li>
<li>More <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/e03-the-modern-pragmatic-honest-version-with-corners-cut">E03 stuff</a>. Guess that's what I didn't blog about in the past 11 days.</li>
<li>snarkyboojum++ and I have started toying with writing a <a href="http://github.com/masak/tardis">time-travelling debugger</a>. Yes, really.</li>
<li>A lot of things are happening in Rakudo-land this month, after the successful ng merge. colomon++ especially shines like a bright star right now, bringing lots of tests back online each day.</li>
<li>I'd like to get enums in Rakudo before this month's release. I've already done anon enums. Next up: named enums.</li>
<li>I've been starting to think seriously about <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/pretending-that-envy-is-one-of-the-perl-virtues">u4x</a> lately. Partly because of other people's questions, partly because it seems the the time is ripe to start it.</li>
<li>However, every time I have that thought I realize that <a href="http://github.com/perl6/book">the book</a> is more important at the moment. I have some unimplemented ideas there as well.</li>
<li><p>GGE is <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/blob/master/STATUS">very near</a> being PGE-compliant. Just a few finishing touches are needed. This will likely usher in a <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/blob/master/docs/COOLTHINGS">new era in Perl 6 grammars and parsing</a>.</p>

<p>Will I have time in the near future to expand these one-liners into full-fledged blog posts? Only time will tell.</p></li>
