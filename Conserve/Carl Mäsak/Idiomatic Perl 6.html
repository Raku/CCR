    <h1><a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/idiomatic-perl-6">Idiomatic Perl 6</a></h1>
  </header>

  <p>So, I wrote a program to generate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal">Pascal's triangle</a>. The first ten rows of the triangle, at least. It only used simple features of Perl 6, such as scalars, nested arrays, and <code>for</code> loops.</p>

<pre><code>my $ELEMENTS = 10;
my @pascal = [1];

for 1 .. $ELEMENTS - 1 {
    my @last = @pascal[ * - 1 ].list;

    my @current;
    push @current, @last[0];
    for 0 .. @last - 2 {
        push @current, @last[$_] + @last[$_ + 1];
    }
    push @current, @last[ * - 1 ];

    push @pascal, [@current];
}

say @pascal.perl;
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, save for simple mechanically substitutable differences, it could have been a Perl 5 script. In fact, with a bit of manual array allocation, it could have been a C script. That's OK; there's a tolerance in the Perl community of writing code that looks like it was thunk in some other language.</p>

<p>But I've heard that Perl 6 is great at doing things with operators. For example, the <code>Z</code> operator, which interleaves two lists, seems to be able to help me write my <code>push</code> statements more succinctly:</p>

<pre><code>my $ELEMENTS = 10;
my @pascal = [1];

for 1 .. $ELEMENTS - 1 {
    my @last = @pascal[ * - 1 ].list;

    my @current;
    <b>for (0, @last) Z (@last, 0) -&gt; $left, $right {<br></br>
        push @current, $left + $right;<br></br>
    }</b> 

    push @pascal, [@current];
}

say @pascal.perl;
</code></pre>

<p>The parentheses before and after the <code>infix:&lt;Z&gt;</code> aren't necessary, because the <code>Z</code> operator has looser precedence than comma. They're just shown here to make your eyes accustomed to reading this construct.</p>

<p>In fact, now that only the addition is performed in the inner loop, I might as well use the <code>Z+</code> operator, which does this for me.</p>

<pre><code>my $ELEMENTS = 10;
my @pascal = [1];

for 1 .. $ELEMENTS - 1 {
    my @last = @pascal[ * - 1 ].list;

    my @current <b>= 0, @last Z+ @last, 0;</b> 

    push @pascal, [@current];
}

say @pascal.perl;
</code></pre>

<p>Now as the remaining loop shrinks to a size I can take in all at once, I see a bit more clearly what I'm doing: I'm building each new list from the previous one. I could feed the previous list into a named function to get the current one:</p>

<pre><code>my $ELEMENTS = 10;
my @pascal = [1];
<b> <br></br>
sub next-list(@p) {<br></br>
    [0, @p Z+ @p, 0]<br></br>
}<br></br>
</b> 
for 1 .. $ELEMENTS - 1 {
    my @last = @pascal[ * - 1 ].list;

    my @current = <b>next-list(@last)</b>;

    push @pascal, @current;
}

say @pascal.perl;
</code></pre>

<p>Or I could just feed it into a in-place anonymous sub.</p>

<pre><code>my $ELEMENTS = 10;
my @pascal = [1];

for 1 .. $ELEMENTS - 1 {
    my @last = @pascal[ * - 1 ].list;

    push @pascal, <b>(sub (@p) { [0, @p Z+ @p, 0] }).(@last)</b>;
}

say @pascal.perl;
</code></pre>

<p>But why even a sub? Perl 6 has a lighter construct, namely a "pointy block" (also known as a "closure" or a "lambda"). It doesn't participate in the call stack, and it's slightly easier to write.</p>

<pre><code>my $ELEMENTS = 10;
my @pascal = [1];

for 1 .. $ELEMENTS - 1 {
    my @last = @pascal[ * - 1 ].list;

    push @pascal, (<b>-&gt; @p</b> { [0, @p Z+ @p, 0] }).(@last);
}

say @pascal.perl;
</code></pre>

<p>Let's look at what the code does. Seed with one element. Calculate the next element based on the previous one. Stop at some point.</p>

<p>But that's exactly what the series operator does. The one that's written with three dots. We have a starting value, a way to get from one value to the next (our code block above), and a stopping value.</p>

<p>Well actually, we don't have the stopping value. But that's OK, since the series operator is <em>lazy</em>. So if we only request the first 10 values, it won't loop forever giving us the rest of the list.</p>

<pre><code><b>my @pascal := do [1], -&gt; @p { [0, @p Z+ @p, 0] } ... *;</b> 

say <b>@pascal[^10]</b>.perl;
</code></pre>

<p>(The extra <code>do</code> required because of a <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=77462">shortcoming in Rakudo</a>.)</p>

<p>Now. Something very much like this code was posted first <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle#Perl_6">on Rosetta code</a> and then <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/pascal-triangle.html">on Moritz' blog</a>. (TimToady used a sub, but said later that he'd have preferred binding.)</p>

<p>A couple of Perl 5 people's reactions were — somewhat uncharacteristically — of a negative flavour, similar to how people <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/perl-6-the-frankensteins-monster-of-operators">seem to react</a> to the periodic table of operators:</p>

<a href="http://twitter.com/shadowcat_mst/status/22112066276">@shadowcat_mst</a>: an excellent example of why I consider camelia perl to be a language research project more than a production language

<a href="http://twitter.com/pedromelo/status/22110965152">@pedromelo</a>: I'm seriously considering this post as an example of what I don't want Perl6 to become... 
</p>

<p>I think these reactions are mainly feature shock. Higher-order operators, pointy blocks, and the series operator... they're all good, well-established features, which find daily use in Perl 6 programs. Maybe using them all together like that flung some people off the deep end. Never mind that the resulting script is all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_complexity">essential complexity</a>, with virtually no boilerplate from the original script left.</p>

<p>This is the first time that's happened. I think it's important to listen to what Perl 5 people think and to try to respond to that. But I also think that this time, it's a case of them seeing some highly idiomatic Perl 6, and freaking out a bit.</p>

<p>And I think that that, in some odd sense, is a good thing. Well, not freaking people out, per se. But the fact that we did shows that there's something forming which might be tentatively called "idiomatic Perl 6": people on the inside can read it quite easily, but those on the outside, even Perl 5 folks looking in, instinctively go "eeeeew!".</p>

<p>That's OK. You're not meant to start with the idiomatic stuff. <em>Language acquisition takes place step by step</em>, and that goes for learning Perl 6 as well. On the way there, just don't confuse distaste with lack of familiarity.</p>
