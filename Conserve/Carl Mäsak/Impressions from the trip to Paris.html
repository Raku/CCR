  <p>Things I will remember from the trip to Paris:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sleeplessly hacking away at presentation software at night at Liz and
Wendy's place. (This was after a fantastic pancake dinner and a set of
competitive games of Martian Fluxx, most of which were won by Liz.) At about
2 o'clock I managed to get the "viewport" in the presentation to pan over
from one slide to another, and then discovered that it all looked smoother
when a sine function was applied to the "reaction coordinate". (<i>(sin(πx -
π/2)+1)/2</i> maps [0,1] to [0,1].) I the found that it looked even nicer
when the sine function was applied twice.</p></li>
<li><p>Giving my <a href="http://github.com/masak/osdc-fr-2010-hardcore-bug-reporting">"Hardcore bug
reporting"</a> talk
and enjoying doing so. I believe I will give this talk again in some form
or other.</p></li>
<li><p>Paris (or at least <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=cite+de+science+et+de+l'industrie,+paris,+france">the part we were in</a>)
being unexpectedly derelict. No complaints about the venue, the hotel, the
people, or the food, which were all excellent. Just the city itself being
ugly beyond my wildest dreams.</p></li>
<li><p>jnthn and mberends sleeping very soundly after an active first day while
I sat cross-legged on my hotel bed, debugging presentation software and
franticly writing slides for my other talk. (Incidentally, I hear there's
a way to actually finish making the slides before the day you're supposed
to give the talk. It's called "using slides from a previous conference",
and I don't do that nearly enough.)</p></li>
<li><p>Giving my other talk, "Perl 6: there's some madness to the method after
all". I feared I might have too few slides, but instead I ran out of time
and had to rush things a bit towards the end. This second talk didn't feel
like a big splash, but might still have a few ideas in it that could be
polished into something good. I kinda like the 'badges' idea.</p></li>
<li><p>French jumping back into my head, annoying me with the readiness by which
my brain could parse it compared to its almost non-existent ability to
produce it. As a small consolation, by the time we handed Liz back to
Wendy, we seemed to have managed to corrupt the former into speaking
English with a heavy lolspeak accent, almost to the same extent as jnthn,
mberends and I.</p></li>
</ul>
