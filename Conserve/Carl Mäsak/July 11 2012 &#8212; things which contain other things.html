  <p>Today I showed a fourteen-year-old how to do rot-13 using Perl 6. Reaction:
"that's awesome". It's things like this that make me realize why I value
talking about programming and explaining programming.</p>

<p>Though I botched it up. I messed around with <code>chr</code> and <code>ord</code> and modulo, when
there's a much shorter and neater way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>sub rot13 { $^s.trans('a..z' =&gt; 'n..za..m', 'A..Z' =&gt; 'N..ZA..M') }
</code></pre>

<p>On the bright side, I get to show that solution tomorrow, and he'll probably
thin it's even more awesome. 哈哈</p>

<p>Today was another pleasant day of just writing tests and implementing them. I
thought I would have one happy path and two sad paths, just like yesterday. But
checking with the original game from last year showed that the last sad path
was actually a happy path too.</p>

<p>Here's today's action:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/a9fe2f791bd27ee81d84eb9b66d6ed6849bb8299">put things in
things</a>.</li>
<li>But only if the latter <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/0161050d5f4c52c58d7d4f23b07b50dbdb1181eb">are
containers</a>.</li>
<li>If you put something in a container which is closed, the game will assume you
meant to <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/38a7ce04933e14c6dfbc0a4a79970cd33d6865aa">open it
first</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was the first time I was tempted to call one behavior (<code>open</code>) from
another (<code>put_thing_in</code>). Eventually I decided against, because my factoring
doesn't make that easy. Which means I will be duplicating some opening logic
inside of the other method. That may or may not become a pain point in the
future; I'll certainly keep an eye out for code smells.</p>

<p>The last commit of the day still leaves things in a slightly unfinished state;
the <code>put_thing_in</code> neglects to apply the events like all other such methods do.
Rather than just instinctively adding that bit of code, I'll note that it
should be added as part of a test failing. So there's at least one missing
test. <code>:-)</code> I can think of a test to expose this case of a missing <code>apply</code>; can
you?</p>
