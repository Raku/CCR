  <p>After sending off yesterday's post, I realized that I didn't have a sad-path
test for putting containers inside themselves.</p>

<p>Then I got to thinking how last year's game handles this. I gave it a whirl:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; put helmet in helmet
You put the helmet in the helmet.
</code></pre>

<p>OMG it worked!</p>

<p>But the funny thing isn't that this impossible act of self-containment is even
possible, but that later when I look at the room, the helmet is <em>gone</em>. So,
where is it? In itself, apparently. It's like the helmet now forms its own
little isolated universe, containing only one item: a helmet.</p>

<p>Or, more succinctly, I suck at programming. <code>:-)</code></p>

<p>jnthn suggested I fix it in this year's game by throwing the exception
<code>X::Adventure::YoDawg</code>. <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/71900d3fe6283d37abdd63661840fcc8578bb9a0">I
oblige</a>.</p>

<p>It's still possible to screw things up with some patience and two portable
containers, I guess. What we really need to guard against are arbitrary cycles
of containership. (Oh you silly adventure gamers!) I can't just forbid
higher-level containers, because it's entirely in order to put a helmet full of
water in the car, for example. Anyway, we'll solve the general case when we
need to. It'll be fun.</p>

<p>This wasn't at all what I was supposed to be doing today. I was supposed to
create platforms. Now, if containers are things you put other things <em>in</em>, then
platforms are things you put other things <em>on</em>. That was the design I ended up
with last year, and I think it'll hold up even this year.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the game, even platformhood is a kind of containment
relation, actually. A butterfly on a pedestal works much like a butterfly in a
car. So I can mostly just copy the tests that apply from yesterday, and make
them work:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/f125f79284baf33c2696f762115f82404f0e0dad">put things on
things</a>.
(And I discovered that an event was unfortunately named.)</li>
<li>But only <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/6d2119f9f9d0678f78b0bc28f2406c6ce642bd80">if the latter is a
platform</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's nice. But we also need to protect about the 'yo dawg' situation with
platforms. Otherwise we might get turtles all the way down. We <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/576954e2faa792bb82329f313f1f503561ed8c52">re-use the
<code>X::Adventure::YoDawg</code>
exception</a>
for this.</p>

<p>And we're done for today. Tomorrow we're gonna learn how to read.</p>
