  <p>This will be a quick one. I dove in today and implemented what I needed. Uhh,
except for the
<a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/cb6dffc11c8f00ab9992d04d520a407270d2918f">bug</a>
<a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/e5c519899a8489d912d4882017a27af14c4f5e61">fixes</a>
I committed along the way because I discovered recently introduced bugs.</p>

<p>Uhm, and except for getting momentarily stuck on the last one. It really wasn't
that difficult, I just managed to misplace my programmer ability for a few
minutes. That happens. The tests kept telling me "no, that's still not it", so
I kept trying until I got it right.</p>

<p>So here's what's new today:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you <code>look</code> at things, the <code>PlayerLooked</code> event returned now includes a
<a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/d807669a4a8e780a964b6bdae00f01c0ed989cc4">list of
things</a>.
Amazingly, adding this did not break any tests.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there's a way to make things "part of the scenery". That means
they're still in the room, but they're <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/af694afa26008e8b50d8aeb872257a1f85761503">not included in that
list</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's interesting. I can feel that focusing on the verbs (as it were) is making
this a better program than last year. What's interesting is that my brain's
spare cycles are figuring out the <em>internal</em> representation of the game engine.
How are rooms and things and containerships represented? I now have a fairly
good idea of this, even for the things I haven't implemented yet.</p>

<p>It's like separating the behavioral outside from the implementational inside
makes it easier to think about both of them separately.</p>

<p>Anyway, we've now had a really good start on "general adventure game
mechanics". I'll probably need a few more course corrections as I map out the
game itself. I'll need to flesh out the container semantics, etc. But the big
brush strokes are there now.</p>

<p>We're ready to implement crypt itself. Let's start doing that tomorrow.</p>
