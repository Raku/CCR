  <p>Many small commits went in today. First, I decided to fix the things that were
missing from yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/9f3040392660ebf6cff869db5a1c9a54155c30c8">take the rope and
flashlight</a>
from the car.</li>
<li>But <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/a309abbc97c17956f8466c6bbbb69d8d19bd4aad">not without opening the
car</a>
first. Happy path, sad path, see?</li>
<li>Also, you can <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/4c6b7f1d52b17cb0b633fe56660ef91c68cf684c">examine things in the
car</a>.</li>
<li><code>look</code> <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/b10aab3cfbaa975a0d3fab63c0dc5c1295b111a3">includes the things in the
room</a>.
Bit of a temp solution, and some duplication, but works for now.</li>
<li>When you take something, <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/42c3cf2bc1b712b4276b6a30e44b56edeaba6f96">the game says you take
it</a>.</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/21ccca88c2fe412957f027a7869c13da29a3ff5d">a quit
message</a>,
just like last year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, now it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/crypt 
CRYPT
=====

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
to find out...

Clearing

The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.
There is a car here.
You can go east.

&gt; examine car
Small, kind of old, and beginning to rust. But it still gets you places.

&gt; examine flashlight
You see no flashlight here.

&gt; open car
Opening the car reveals a flashlight and a rope.

&gt; examine flashlight
The flashlight, a trusty Flexmann 520, has been serving you for countless
adventures.

&gt; take flashlight
You take the flashlight.

&gt; quit
Thanks for playing.
</code></pre>

<p>The only small detail that's wrong now is that there should be a "custom
description" for the car, and the game should really say "Your car is parked
here." I have a plan for how to fix this. But not today. All in due time.</p>

<p>Now, what I <em>really</em> meant to do today was this:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/50aeeb08534b73d37ffc12ba0fe6ce78b40887cc">open the door on the
hill</a>.</li>
<li>But not without <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/bb4788a700be527003a6223e6628793256c5d887">first examining the
grass</a>
where the door is hidden.</li>
<li>Or, as it happens, <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/a2c7c9e5c574102eeabfae41b5c288b46aa188d4">the
bushes</a>.</li>
<li>Then, let's <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/dcd529a43f048194854113291357a99e38ca9326">open the door and walk
through</a>.</li>
<li>But walking south is only supposed to work <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/27722eec71fb8f5528f41aeb6e4809760c151792">if you open the door
first</a>,
silly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementing this game is great; today more than previous days I'm feeling just
how great. The foundation I've built in the first part of the month is not just
suitable for building adventure games, it's <em>perfect</em>.  It's fantastic. Look at
this:</p>

<pre><code># Things on hill
.place_thing('grass', 'hill');
.make_thing_implicit('grass');
.place_thing('bushes', 'hill');
.make_thing_implicit('bushes');
.place_thing('door', 'hill');
.make_thing_openable('door');
.hide_thing('door');
.on_examine('grass', { .unhide_thing('door') });
.on_examine('bushes', { .unhide_thing('door') });
.on_open('door', { .connect(&lt;hill chamber&gt;, 'south') });
</code></pre>

<p>It's an adventure game world building API! (Yes, others will be able to take it
and run with it too, as long as I separate <code>Adventure::Engine</code> out into its own
module and publish it on <a href="http://modules.perl6.org">modules.perl6.org</a>).</p>

<p>And not just that. The tests are wonderful, too!</p>

<pre><code>my $game = Crypt::Game.new();

$game.open('car');
is $game.examine('flashlight'),
    Adventure::PlayerExamined.new(
        :thing&lt;flashlight&gt;,
    ),
    'examining the flashlight in the car';
</code></pre>

<p>I'm very happy about how this is turning out. All programming should be like
this.</p>
