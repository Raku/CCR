  <p>Implementing flashlight/torch logic is straightforward but not without its
surprises. Nevertheless, I have two commits for you today as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>First, we <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/e90ce36e75c3d845951f22490e93c5dbfb8916cb">switched off the
light</a>
in the hall.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now to get the flashlight to work.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the flashlight has been switched on, it should <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/bc2bb141e7ea50a526db00736814d6d39c6f0d4e">light up the
room</a>.
Actually, it's not that simple. The flashlight can be switched on because
it's a <em>light source</em>. And then it has to be actually on. And then it has
to be <em>in the room</em>, or in the player's inventory, which is conceptually
in the room, too. Finally we have to tell the game engine that <code>use</code> has the
particular meaning <code>switch on</code> for light sources. Phew!</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm happy about today's harvest of events:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>PlayerLookedAtDarkness</code></li>
<li><code>RoomMadeDark</code></li>
<li><code>PlayerUsed</code></li>
<li><code>ThingMadeALightSource</code></li>
<li><code>LightSourceSwitchedOn</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Very descriptive. Oh, and there should also be an exception <code>TooDark</code>, but
there's nothing in the hall yet to try it on. Will add it tommorrow.</p>

<p>I'm starting to suffer very slightly from scaling issues. The whole <code>bin/crypt</code>
file is now 2485 lines long, but that's partly because it contains
<em>everything</em>: game engine, crypt game, hanoi subgame, and tests for all of
them. So there's some splitting up to do before the month is over.</p>

<p>But there's also the fact that the <code>Adventure::Engine</code> class has 21 attributes,
which is a bit much. I suspect it could easily be given a few inner classes to
handle rooms and things separately, and that that would help combat the
monolithic list of attributes. Luckily, such a refactor will be very
straightforward, since we're not exposing any internals at all.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be interesting &mdash; that's when we integrate the hanoi game we
wrote at the beginning of the month. I... I hope it fits in with the rest of
the game. 哈哈</p>
