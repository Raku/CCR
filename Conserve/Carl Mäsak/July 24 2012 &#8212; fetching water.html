  <p>It's five months until Christmas, and I'm coding up tests and implementation
for my Perl 6 adventure game to allow me to fetch water from a brook. Life
could be worse. 哈哈</p>

<p>Github, roll the commits!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/e4f2c0ce868fedf2fd6c6db76cf89daed9f32a56">There's now a helmet</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/ecf3cabe62314a44460b0bfb228e62e668336425">You can't take
it</a>
if it's pitch black.  I talked about adding this a few days ago. Now I got around to it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/0287a471826dbb117408fe4bad00a01966d6550b">You can't examine it
either</a>
if it's pitch black.</li>
<li>Let's add <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/08d990461038d5301ea14083a6745306f95cc1d9">a brook and
water</a>
to the hill. I feel like a landscape architect here.</li>
<li>There are two ways to fetch water. One is the more direct <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/45e6ac87166bf3c461b0344c48be07ec842ea1ed">"put water in
helmet"</a>,
which works.</li>
<li>Some people, however, feel like it should work equally well to put the helmet
in the brook and then pick it up again. They are right; that should work. And <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/48c757550e531083bb32e825749f3d57cb429d63">now it
does</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't have much to say in the way of comments. Making those commits was very
straightforward. The last one meant a little tinkering around since I had to
add yet another hook/listener. But not so bad overall.</p>

<p>Working this way really feels like "programming in the domain". The events and
exceptions really help in this regard. I want to program more things like this.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we'll use our newly-fetched water to put out the fire. Then we'll have
access to the innermost room... the room after which the game is named... the
<em>crypt</em>, where it's silent as a grave, because well, you know.</p>

<p>Not much left now.</p>
