  <p>The game is finished. Now we're making it better. There's a lot of things to
make better.</p>

<p>Like,</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/dc328199a2a1cb6aefc3c3ae039b4b68b052378d">help
text</a>.</li>
<li>Writing <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/8325b8e6b8fddeff21b0d8059c13d81e30b9490c"><code>n</code> instead of
<code>north</code></a>,
optionally with <code>go</code> or <code>walk</code> before it. That was today's task, as far as I can tell.
A disproportionately small one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and just playing the game for a while, I noticed that I couldn't examine
things once I had taken them. So I <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/b8f270b6bab68a8332568b9f90250ba3c09e7dfa">fixed
that</a>.
Speaking of which,</p>

<ul>
<li>There's now an <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/8d2d80880bc73bf110accc9cebccf89bed20d74f">inventory
command</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ah, it's fun to be playing the game again.</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/crypt 
CRYPT
=====

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
to find out...

Clearing

The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.
There is a car here.
You can go east.

&gt; inventory
You are empty-handed.

&gt; open car
You open the car.
Opening the car reveals a flashlight and a rope.

&gt; take flashlight
You take the flashlight.

&gt; take rope
You take the rope.

&gt; inventory
You are carrying:
A flashlight.
A rope.

&gt; quit

Thanks for playing.
</code></pre>

<p>There's still a few days left. I need as many people as possible to get in
there, play the game, and flush things out that are wrong or could be improved.
So if you have a few minutes, give the game a whirl. I'll do my best to fix
things quickly.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are bugs in there. <a href="http://github.com/masak/crypt/">Help me find them</a>!</p>
