  <p>Let's write an adventure game. Again. ☺</p>

<p>We can start by <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/247f52c0bc26534d372b4211050f146bc739cdef">writing a command
loop</a>.
It's a reduced version of the loop we wrote yesterday for the Hanoi game.</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/crypt 
CRYPT
=====

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
to find out...

&gt; look 
Sorry, I did not understand that.

&gt; quit
</code></pre>

<p>Neat. But the game doesn't understand <code>look</code> yet. We need to do something about
that. Time to write our first test.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/c848fd4cfe1ffabf0deb16c46ac7a173c7feec5b">implement
looking</a>.
See how easy it is. (Yes, we are hardcoding things when we can get away with
it. But that's OK; then we'll need to write tests to make sure they can
change.)</p>

<p>Now we <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/2efa9e7e9b6a61e994ea7cdbba8dfbc99f55b053">hook looking into the command
loop</a>.</p>

<p>Now this happens:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/crypt 
CRYPT
=====

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
to find out...

&gt; look
&lt;clearing&gt;

&gt; quit
</code></pre>

<p>Well, it works, but... we have some presentation issues. Last year we added a
file <code>descriptions</code> with text descriptions of everything. Let's <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/a36b8dd89fce10613c0aaf75e21636cf06fd1a3d">do that
now</a>,
and plug it into the <code>PlayerLooked</code> event.</p>

<p>Now things look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/crypt 
CRYPT
=====

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
to find out...

&gt; look
The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.

&gt; quit
</code></pre>

<p>We're off to a good start.</p>

<p>Some observations: notice how we're following a model-view kind of thinking
here. The <code>Crypt::Game</code> class is the model, and our <code>MAIN()</code> method is a view.
We don't bother the model with the actual descriptions of things; these end up
in the view.</p>

<p>I was a bit hesitant in making <code>PlayerLooked</code> an event. It felt like looking
might be a "pure" operation without side effects. Then I remembered that
sometimes in the game looking <em>does</em> have side effects. So it definitely
belongs there. If looking didn't have side effects, we might handle looking
entirely in the <code>MAIN()</code> method. But I think I prefer it this way.</p>

<p>Ok, that's it for today. Tomorrow we'll add walking around to our repertoire.</p>
