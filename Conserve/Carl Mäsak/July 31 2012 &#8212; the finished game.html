  <p>All last days of a project should be like this.</p>

<p>No stress. No looming deadline, just a normal deadline. No tearing one's
hair. No failing test, just 144 really good passing ones.</p>

<p>First, I fixed something that I realized earlier today: I don't need to
special-case the wrapper methods for <code>take</code> and <code>put_thing_on</code> with special
handling of the tiny disk and its interaction with the bounded Hanoi context.
Now that all the disks and rods are objects in the game, I'll just <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/4a89e8f3f057ca8be7d9e448abc9968be991b839">add more
hooks</a>.
Nice.</p>

<p>Then it was time to split the big script file into smaller modules and test
files.</p>

<pre><code>$ wc bin/crypt 
  3483   8026 103863 bin/crypt
</code></pre>

<p>100 KB! All of it written this month... that means I've netted around 3 KB of
code per day. Hm, that actually sounds about right.</p>

<p>Anyway, some splitting later...</p>

<pre><code>$ wc `find bin lib t -type f`
   334   1007  12198 bin/crypt
   938   1931  25364 lib/Adventure/Engine.pm
   276    612   9013 lib/Crypt/Game.pm
     9     31    274 lib/Event.pm
   327   1021   9950 lib/Hanoi/Game.pm
   309   1010   9726 t/hanoi.t
   714   1227  16398 t/crypt.t
   633   1359  17366 t/adventure-engine.t
  3540   8198 100289 total
</code></pre>

<p>The script file completely deflated; it now only contains the <code>MAIN</code> routine
for the game. Even it could be largely factored out into an
<code>Adventure::Engine::REPL</code> or something, but right now it's a little too coupled
with crypt for me to attempt that.</p>

<p>Much of the general logic went into <code>Adventure::Engine</code>, not surprisingly.
<code>Crypt::Game</code> now mostly contains the world-building logic and some wrapper
methods.</p>

<p>The test files also distribute easily. 54 <code>hanoi.t</code> tests. The <code>crypt.t</code> and
<code>adventure-engine.t</code> tests were all mixed together in one <code>MAIN</code> multi, but
they were easy to tease apart. (A deeper issue there is that some tests in
<code>crypt.t</code> would need to be duplicated, anonymized ("de-crypted", heh), and put
into <code>adventure-engine.t</code> so that it gets better coverage. I might get to
that.)</p>

<p>If you're wondering why things got <em>smaller</em> from this, I think it was because
some amount of indentation actually disappeared from the test files. Those
tests were all in separate <code>MAIN</code> routines previously &mdash; indented one
level. Now they're not.</p>

<p>But, just splitting things apart wasn't enough. I had promised to move
<code>Adventure::Engine</code> into its own repository as an independent module, so <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/e10a8b7f252667d3fa61b3df44ae6b0fdc09fb79">I did
that</a>.
It can now be found at
<a href="https://github.com/masak/Adventure-Engine"><code>github/masak/Adventure-Engine</code></a>.</p>

<p>Then I took the chance to publish crypt as well. I published it as
<code>Crypt::Game</code>, which was probably a mistake from an module naming perspective.
I'll investigate tomorrow what it takes to rename the module <code>Game::Crypt</code>.</p>

<p>Both modules can be found at <a href="http://modules.perl6.org/"><code>modules.perl6.org</code></a>,
of course. You should be able to install it with Panda now, though I haven't
tried.</p>

<p>The contest for finding bugs in the adventure game is now closed as well, and I
do have a winner &mdash; to be announced. If anyone wants to sneak in at the
end with lots of bug reports and suggestions for improvements, I won't be
impossible. The later they are, though, the more awesome they have to be in
order for me not to consider them to be too late.</p>

<p>...and that concludes this day's work, and this blogging month. Thanks for
following along this far. I'll probably sum up the month and what I learned,
when I've regained enough strength to do that.</p>
