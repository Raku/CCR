  <p>We learned to see (<code>look</code>) yesterday, but what about moving around (<code>walk</code>)?</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/crypt
CRYPT
=====

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
to find out...

&gt; look     
The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.

&gt; walk east
Sorry, I did not understand that.

&gt; quit
</code></pre>

<p>Aww, that's not much fun! Let's fix that!</p>

<p>I'm doing this as I go along; I haven't prepared much before. That means that
sometimes I realize a bunch of stuff as I code. I prefer that; means things are
still fresh for me to explain. But it also means sometimes I change things back
and forth as I try for the best way to factor things. I pray your indulgence.</p>

<p>Anyway, taking a step back to design and language for a while:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The player can <strong>walk</strong> in our adventure game, because we have a concept of <strong>rooms</strong>,
each one having zero or more <strong>exits</strong> connecting to other rooms. We talk about
<strong>connecting</strong> two rooms to give them exits to each other. Rooms can also be
<strong>disconnected</strong>. Rooms and their connections form a sort of topology, a graph on
which the player moves. The topology may change during the course of the game,
as rooms connect to and disconnect from each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we implement <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/0e3976e9f5ae622e4b3c4d662f1d59be4b7ddd59">connecting two
rooms</a>;
feels like a good start. And of course, you're not allowed to <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/e0290f34333d4ff2cddeac09cf450bc2dd24c8ee">use directions
that don't
exist</a>.</p>

<p>Note that in our script, we make a distinction between <code>Crypt::Game</code> and
<code>Adventure::Engine</code>. The former is the actual crypt game, with its various
puzzles and descriptions; the latter is a general adventure game engine, which
handles regular things such as connecting rooms and walking. <code>Crypt::Game</code>
actually wraps <code>Adventure::Engine</code> and delegates some commands directly to
it (such as walking), but completely hides other commands (such as connecting
rooms). This division feels like it makes a lot of sense. (Essentially it
also means that as the month draws to an end, we could separate out the
<code>Adventure::Engine</code> parts and publish them on modules.perl6.org. Not that I
want to give any of you any ideas.)</p>

<p>Anyway, now we can <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/4b468fb3606bffe1f15dd1e9bb88101427d748ce">implement
walking</a>.
And, as usual, we don't just think "happy path", but make sure <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/6dc36736bfbefda2ad41e09f035ba1d4926d42cb">walking doesn't
work without an
exit</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>Crypt::Game</code> class now has a <code>BUILD</code> method that sets things up using
<code>Adventure::Engine</code>. The idea is that this is how you "configure" an adventure
game; in the <code>BUILD</code> method. We'll see how that works out in practice.</p>

<p>(Actually the biggest point of cheating I introduced today was this line in the
above commit:</p>

<pre><code>has $!player_location = 'clearing';
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with it is that it is in <code>Adventure::Engine</code>, which is the wrong
context for that initialization to be in. (Not all adventure games start in a
clearing.) I'll fix that in the next few days.)</p>

<p>And then we need to do one more thing to make <code>walk</code> work in the actual game.
We need to <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/457e63f913a539b3f7e991c2736627fbe180e859">bind CLI commands to method
calls</a>.
Yes, I adapted that bit from the Hanoi game.</p>

<p>And lo, walking now works!</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/crypt
CRYPT

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these

to find out...

&gt; walk south
Cannot walk south because there is no exit there.

&gt; walk east

&gt; quit
</code></pre>

<p>We would really like to get automatic descriptions when we walk into new
places. We'll handle that (<em>me checks schedule</em>) day after tomorrow. But note,
we <em>didn't</em> get an error message from walking east, which is exactly what we
wanted. (Because there is an exit east from the clearing to the hill.)</p>

<p>Just one last thing today. Have a look at what happens if I...</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/crypt

<p>Yeah, um. You might actually look at that output and figure out what's wrong.
Then again, you might not.</p>

<p>We only added one connection, between <code>clearing</code> and <code>hill</code>. Going east a
second time should blow up on us. <em>Unless</em>... unless the player position never
gets updated.</p>

<p>What do we do when finding something like this? We <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/4d8064f7a7bc76861c94f4e44128abd9cb26dcd4">add a failing test case and
make it
pass</a>.</p>

<p>Yay!</p>

<p>That's it for today.</p>
