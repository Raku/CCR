  </header>

  <p>Now that we have the mechanical underpinnings for connecting rooms the way we
want, let's <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/262cd871708df58ea91b3c81b828fb050e59a255">connect all the
rooms</a>
in the entire dungeon. The game is not really this simple, but being able to
walk between all the rooms will serve us well today.</p>

<p>Oh, and the CLI should really <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/e478ae2393329b113606eea037562ddce66e15fd">announce the
rooms</a>
as we enter them, so that we know where we are.</p>

<p>Does it work? Well, have a look for yourself:</p>

<pre><code>CRYPT
=====

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
to find out...

Clearing

&gt; walk east
Hill

&gt; walk in
Chamber

&gt; walk south
Hall

&gt; walk down
Cave

&gt; walk northwest
Crypt

&gt; walk southeast
Cannot walk southeast because there is no exit there.

&gt; quit
</code></pre>

<p>So we can walk all the way into the dungeon... but when we try to turn around
and go back, we get a disappointing "no exit there" error.</p>

<p>Why? Well, we haven't made room connections bidirectional yet. <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/9a7f528d5b92e1659cfa32c12f43a9b21581a6cf">Let's do
that</a>.</p>

<p>Now we can walk into the crypt, and then back out again.</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/crypt
CRYPT
=====

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
to find out...

Clearing

&gt; walk east
Hill

&gt; walk in
Chamber

&gt; walk south
Hall

&gt; walk down
Cave

&gt; walk northwest
Crypt

&gt; walk southeast
Cave

&gt; walk up
Hall

&gt; walk north
Chamber

&gt; walk out
Hill

&gt; quit
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm getting tired far too fast of having to write <code>walk</code> all the time. So
we <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/a9c83c02de04f9604e4eb7a5dead4e5c5e148b7d">allow an abbreviated
way</a>
to write this. More abbreviations to come, of course.</p>

<pre><code>CRYPT

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
to find out...

Clearing

Hill

&gt; west

&gt; quit
</code></pre>

<p>It works. Nice.</p>

<p>Finally, we make the adventure engine <a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/8896863e9baa0130977bad88c65106e58dd95cef">automatically <code>look</code> at new
rooms</a>
(whether we walk into them or are transported there). And then we make the CLI
<a href="https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/1c7f6e2f38bba5261ecba4d3e6f9be50b1106088">print descriptions when we
look</a>.
(Only when doing this last commit did I notice that I had accidentally removed
the <code>look</code> command earlier in the commit history. Well, now it works again, and
without a special case.) We also add in all the room descriptions from last year.</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/crypt
CRYPT
=====

You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
to find out...

Clearing

The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.

&gt; east
Hill

A flat, broad hill interrupts the dense-ish forest here. Only grass and
small bushes grow on the hill.

&gt; in
Chamber

This is a cramped space just inside the hidden opening in the hill. The
sun gets in enough to illuminate the place. There are some scribblings on
the wall.

&gt; south
Hall

It's hard to believe that this kind of room can fit under a hill. It's tall,
long, and quite spacious. Hieroglyphs adorn all four of the walls. The
floor slants a bit.

&gt; down
Cave

This is a perfectly cylindrical chamber. An oversized fire-pit takes up most
of the floor space in the middle of the room. Ancient runes run along the
circumference of the wall. It's hot and stuffy.

&gt; northwest
Crypt

The air is stale and smells a bit metallic. Three impenetrable sarcophagi
sit next to each other on the floor. On the walls are numerous finely
inscribed ideograms.

&gt; quit
</code></pre>

<p>So, it's all starting to look like an adventure game. We can walk around and
look at stuff.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we'll add save/restore functionality to the game. This is wonderfully
easy because we're basing our whole design on serializable events.</p>
