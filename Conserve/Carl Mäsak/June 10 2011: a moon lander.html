  <p>The good news: you've made it all the way to the moon. Congratulations!</p>

<p>The bad news: due to a terrible misjudgment, your moon lander doesn't have as much fuel available as would be desirable. It will take all your concentration to make a soft touch-down. Use the fuel you have, by all means, but <em>not too soon</em>! (Also, don't use it too late.)</p>

<p>Here we go.</p>

<pre><code>my $altitude = 70;
my $velocity = 0;
my $fuel     = 7;

my $LANDER = "&lt;|";
my $GROUND = "|";

loop {
    my $int_alt = $altitude.Int;
    my $view = " " x (70 - $int_alt) ~ $LANDER ~ " " x $int_alt ~ $GROUND;

    say $view;
    say "Altitude: $altitude -- Velocity: $velocity -- Fuel: $fuel";

    given prompt "command&gt; " {
        when "thrust" {
            if $fuel &gt; 0 {
                $fuel--;
                $velocity += 3;
            }
            else {
                say "You can't, you're out of fuel!";
            }
        }
        when "wait" {
            # Waiting means doing nothing
        }
        when "quit" {
            say "Good-bye. It was nice trying to land with you.";
            last;
        }
        default {
            say "Available commands:";
            say "";
            say "thrust -- fire the thruster";
            say "wait   -- don't fire the thruster";
            say "quit   -- exit the simulation";
            say "help   -- get this list of commands";

            redo;
        }
    }

    $velocity -= 1.5;
    $altitude += $velocity;

    if $altitude &lt;= 0 {
        last;
    }
}

if $velocity &gt;= -3 {
    say " " x 70, $LANDER, $GROUND;
    say "You land softly on the moon.";
}
else {
    say " " x 70, "*#", $GROUND;
    say "You crash fatally into the moon's surface.";
    say "Condolences will be sent to your family.";
}

say "Thanks for playing.";

<p>Slightly longer than we've seen so far, but that's just because it's quite a nice game. There's nothing especially new in there.</p>

<p>Well, there are a few things that deserve a mention:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We've used capitals for the variables <code>$LANDER</code> and <code>$GROUND</code> because we don't expect them to change during the course of the program. That's a way of indicating that they're really constants.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>$int_alt</code> variable is there merely for esthetic purposes. <code>.Int</code> converts the altitude to an integer (a whole number), which comes out nicer when we use it for building strings on the next line. Sometimes the altitude is something-point-five, which makes the ground wobble a little. We don't want that.</p></li>
<li><p>We don't bother saving <code>prompt "command&gt; "</code> into a variable this time &mdash; we just throw it straight into a <code>given</code> statement. That's quite alright.</p></li>
<li><p>Recall that <code>$velocity += 3</code> means <code>$velocity = $velocity + 3</code>. It's just a short form for when we have the same variable on both sides of the assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Yeah, we're cheating a bit with the <code>"help"</code> command. We're putting it in a <code>default</code> clause, so that it actually catches all miscellaneous commands... including <code>"help"</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You'll recall that <code>last</code> immediately takes us out of a loop. <code>redo</code>, on the other hand, immediately restarts the loop. Which is what we want after showing the list of available commands, rather than crashing into the moon.</p></li>
<li><p>There are a number of better ways to write the big <code>loop {}</code>, in this case, because we know when the game is over: when the altitude gets nonpositive. We could write any of these ways instead: <code>while $altitude &gt; 0 { ... }</code> or <code>until $altitude &lt;= 0 { ... }</code> or <code>repeat until $altitude &lt;= 0 { ... }</code> or <code>repeat { ... } until altitude &lt;= 0</code> (or other obvious permutations). The presence of the <code>repeat</code> keyword would simply guarantee that we run the loop at least once.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Have fun playing! I know I did. The moon is harder than it looks. <code>:-)</code></p>
