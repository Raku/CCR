    <h1><a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/june-11-2011-arrays">June 11 2011: arrays</a></h1>
  </header>

  <p>All the variables we've seen so far have had dollar signs (<code>$</code>) up front. We call them <em>scalar variables</em>. They are distinguished by the fact that they have room for one value at a time.</p>

<pre><code>my $greeting = "Hello, World!";
say $greeting;
</code></pre>

<p>Today we'll talk about a new kind of variables, <em>array variables</em>, which can contain a sequence of values, and which are written with an at-sign (<code>@</code>):</p>

<pre><code>my @ingredients = "flour", "salt", "sugar", "milk", "eggs", "butter";
say "To make pancakes, you need these ingredients:";
say @ingredients.join(" ");  # "flour salt sugar milk eggs butter"
</code></pre>

<p>So the variable <code>@ingredients</code> contains six things, all string values in this case. But they could easily be numbers, or other kinds of values.</p>

<p>Note that we made use of the method call <code>.join(" ")</code> when we wanted to print the array. It makes sure to put a space between each value before printing them. (<code>.join</code> takes an array or a list and produces a single string, putting a separator &mdash; <code>" "</code> in this case &mdash; between each element.)</p>

<p>Had we just printed the elements, the ingredients would've been harder to read:</p>

<pre><code>say @ingredients;  # "floursaltsugarmilkeggsbutter"
</code></pre>

<p>Try saying that quickly five times. :P</p>

<p>There's also a way to fill up an array element by element:</p>

<pre><code>my @ingredients;  # created empty
push @ingredients, "flour";
push @ingredients, "salt";
push @ingredients, "sugar";
push @ingredients, "milk";
push @ingredients, "eggs";
push @ingredients, "butter";
</code></pre>

<p>And then we can take them out again one by one if we want:</p>

<pre><code># we've already done all the push-ing
say pop @ingredients; # "butter"
say pop @ingredients; # "eggs"
say pop @ingredients; # "milk"
say pop @ingredients; # "sugar"
say pop @ingredients; # "salt"
say pop @ingredients; # "flour"
</code></pre>

<p>But, hey, look at that! They came out backwards!</p>

<p>That's no coincidence. <code>push</code> adds to the end of the array, and <code>pop</code> removes from the end of the array. Together they make the array act like a so-called <em>stack</em>; think of a stack of plate, where you always add and remove plates at the top.</p>

<p>But surely we could get things out in a non-reversed order if we wanted? Yes, of course:</p>

<pre><code># we've already done all the push-ing
say shift @ingredients; # "butter"
say shift @ingredients; # "eggs"
say shift @ingredients; # "milk"
say shift @ingredients; # "sugar"
say shift @ingredients; # "salt"
say shift @ingredients; # "flour"
</code></pre>

<p>So, <code>shift</code> removes things from the start of the array. Together, <code>push</code> and <code>shift</code> act like a <em>queue</em>, like a line of people waiting for something. You won't get served until all the people ahead of you have been.</p>

<p>To complete the set of operations, there's a fourth one called <code>unshift</code> which adds something to the start of the array. That's the least used one.</p>

<pre><code>unshift ---&gt; +-------+ &lt;--- push
             | array |
  shift &lt;--- +-------+ ---&gt; pop

             +-------+ &lt;--- push
             | stack |
             +-------+ ---&gt; pop

             +-------+ &lt;--- push
             | queue |
  shift &lt;--- +-------+
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, there's a way to operate on individual values if we want to:</p>

<pre><code>my @ingredients = "flour", "salt", "sugar", "milk", "eggs", "butter";

say @ingredients[3];        # "milk" -- keep in mind, we start indexing at 0

@ingredients[3] = "cream";  # ooh, luxury pancakes!
say @ingredients.join(" "); # "flour salt sugar cream eggs butter"
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know about you, but I'm going to make myself some pancakes <em>right now</em>. Tomorrow we'll tackle <code>for</code> loops.</p>
