  </header>

  <p>Yesterday, we went through array variables, and there was much rejoicing. We saw how to add and remove things at the ends. We learned how to treat arrays as a single item. We learned how to inspect and change individual array elements.</p>

<p>But there's something missing still. Something important. We will often want a way to say, "for every element in this array, do this...".</p>

<p>We need a kind of loop for arrays.</p>

<pre><code>my @seasons = "winter", "spring", "summer", "fall";

for @seasons {
    say "Yay, $_!";
}

# Yay, winter!
# Yay, spring!
# Yay, summer!
# Yay, fall!
</code></pre>

<p>In the olden days, one used to loop through arrays by repeatedly increasing an index counter (often called <code>$i</code>), and then indexing the array with it. This is now considered gauche and primitive.</p>

<p>Our good friend the topic variable <code>$_</code> shows up again here. The for loop takes care of <em>binding</em> it to the appropriate value; in this case, it is bound to each element in the array in turn. Since the array contains four elements, we make four iterations through it. Simple.</p>

<p>So, to summarize, <code>given</code> sets the topic for a single value, whereas <code>for</code> sets the topic for each of the elements in an array or list.</p>

<p>Sometimes we want a more descriptive name than just <code>$_</code>. The topic variable is fine for shorter loops, but when programs get larger and one can't see the closing brace of a block from its opening brace, it increasingly makes sense to name the variable something else.</p>

<p>We <em>could</em> do this each time:</p>

<pre><code>my @seasons = "winter", "spring", "summer", "fall";

for @seasons {
    my $season = $_;
    say "Yay, $season!";
}
</code></pre>

<p>But there's a nicer way:</p>

<pre><code>my @seasons = "winter", "spring", "summer", "fall";

for @seasons -&gt; $season {
    say "Yay, $season!";
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the latter case, <code>$_</code> is <em>not</em> set, so any value that it had before will be preserved. You could think of it as the "default" of a <code>for</code> loop being <code>-&gt; $_</code>, which is correct enough for now.</p>

<p>We don't have to loop over arrays, either. Here's a short program that loops over the words that we input:</p>

<pre><code>my $sentence = prompt "Enter a sentence: ";

for $sentence.words -&gt; $word {
    say "'$word' has $word.chars() characters";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Running the program could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Enter a sentence: This isn't my hamster
'This' has 4 characters
'isn't' has 5 characters
'my' has 2 characters
'hamster' has 7 characters
</code></pre>

<p>Two new methods above: <code>.words</code> is a method on a string that returns a list of contiguous "word characters" (anything but whitespace).</p>

<p><code>.chars</code> gives the length (number of characters) of a string. Note that we can even do method calls and have them interpolate in strings; the proviso is that we end in parentheses (<code>()</code>).</p>

<p>That's it for today. Tomorrow we'll have a look at regexes, whatever that may be. <code>:-)</code></p>
