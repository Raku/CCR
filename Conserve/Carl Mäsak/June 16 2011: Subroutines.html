  </header>

  <p>Our programs are getting rather long, and they're all in one piece. Even with <code>if</code>s and loops to make it more fun, it's all just one big string of instructions. As our programs keep expanding, that will be harder and harder to maintain.</p>

<p>We need a way to subdivide our programs. Enter the subroutine. (Or, shorter, the "sub".)</p>

<pre><code>sub miniprogram {  # declare it
    say "Hello.";
    say "I'm a little isolated world of my own.";
    say "And now I'm finished. kthxbai";
}

miniprogram;       # call it
</code></pre>

<p>A legitimate question at this point is: "Why did we do that?" More exactly, what did we gain from putting code inside a subroutine and then calling the subroutine? Isn't it always more straightforward to... not do that?</p>

<p>Well, no. There are at least two good reasons for stowing away code in subroutines:</p>

<ul>
<li>We can give pieces of code descriptive names. That's more important than one might think.</li>
<li>We can call the same piece of code from several different places. That means that we avoid repeating that same stretch of code; instead we just repeat a small subroutine name each time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Later, there'll be a third good reason, having to do with modules and the sharing of code.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning two more things about subroutines. First, they can return values:</p>

<pre><code>sub roll_die {
    return (1..6).roll;
}

say roll_die;    # and it rolls the die
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>return</code> there means "exit the sub immediately with the following value". <code>return</code>ing with no value is fine, too. You can <code>return</code> at the end of a subroutine, or from the middle of it. Whatever value you return becomes the value of the whole sub call. You can take that value, store it in a variable, print it, etc. If you don't have a <code>return</code> in your subroutine, the last value in the routine will be returned automatically.</p>

<p>The other thing that's worth knowing is that you can pass things <em>into</em> a sub.</p>

<pre><code>sub add($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}

say add(10, 25);    # "35"
</code></pre>

<p>Well, that was easy! You just declare a number of <em>parameters</em> &mdash; <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> in this case &mdash; and then you can call the subroutine with that many values.</p>

<p>Here's another example:</p>

<pre><code>sub greet($name) {
    say "Hello $name";
}

greet(prompt "What's your name? ");    # "Hello &lt;name&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>This program will first prompt for a name, and whatever the user types in will be used as a parameter <code>$name</code> by the <code>greet</code> sub. (What <code>prompt</code> returns, <code>greet</code> will consume.)</p>

<p>In a lot of places, the parentheses are optional, and a matter of taste. This also works:</p>

<pre><code>greet prompt "What's your name? ";     # "Hello &lt;name&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>It's up to you whether you think that's clearer of more confusing. <code>:-)</code></p>

<p>The important thing to remember, if you <em>do</em> use parentheses, is that they should come directly after the sub name, without intervening space:</p>

<pre><code>add(4, 4);    # will work
add (4, 4);   # will NOT work
</code></pre>

<p>Usually whitespace doesn't matter that much, but for sub calls (and things like indexings) it does matter.</p>

<p>There's a lot more to say about subroutines. But this will serve us for now.</p>
