  <p>Hashes are like phone books. We use them to go from one thing (like a name) to another thing (like a phone number).</p>

<pre><code>my %phone_numbers =
    "Ada"     =&gt; "555-414141",
    "Charles" =&gt; "555-567123",
    "Ernest"  =&gt; "555-832238";
</code></pre>

<p>Hashes are written with a percent sign (<code>%</code>) up front. Not to be confused with when the percent sign is used as the remainder operator. That's a totally different usage.</p>

<p>We index hashes much like we index arrays. But instead of <code>[]</code>, we tend to use <code>&lt;&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>say %phone_numbers&lt;Ada&gt;;    # "555-414141"
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, the above way only works if what we're indexing with is a literal string value. If it's a variable or something more complicated, we need to use <code>{}</code>:</p>

<pre><code>my $inventor = "Charles";
say %phone_numbers{$inventor};  # "555-567123"
</code></pre>

<p>Assignment to hash values works in the same way.</p>

<p>Apart from that, there are plenty of useful methods on hashes:</p>

<pre><code>say %phone_numbers.elems;            # "3"
say join " ", %phone_numbers.keys;   # "Charles Ada Ernest"
say join " ", %phone_numbers.values; # "555-567123 555-414141 555-832238"
</code></pre>

<p>The lists of things returned from <code>.keys</code> and <code>.values</code> will come out in some unspecified order. This is because hashes, unlike the real phone book, aren't sorted. We basically want hashes as a fast, string-based indexing system. And if it's supposed to be fast, it can't also be ordered, because it would take too long to add new things to a hash.</p>

<p>It's worth knowing about something in hashes called <em>autovivification</em>. That's a fancy term for this effect:</p>

<pre><code>my %h;
say %h.elems;       # "0", of course

say %h&lt;chocolate&gt;;  # "Any()", means there's nothing there
say %h.elems;       # "0", still

%h&lt;chocolate&gt;++;    # here is where the autoviv happens
say %h.elems;       # "1"

say %h.keys;        # "chocolate"
say %h.values;      # "1"
</code></pre>

<p>In many other languages, you get an error if you increment a hash entry that doesn't exist. In Perl, incrementing something that isn't there causes it to spring into existence. We'll often use that to our advantage.</p>

<p>I have to go; I believe that's Ada on the other line. See you tomorrow for... some other topic.</p>
