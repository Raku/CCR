  </header>

  <p>We've seen junctions a bit already. They showed up as a sidekick to the slightly longer logical operators:</p>

<pre><code>if $answer == 1 || $answer == 3 { ... }

if $answer == 1 | 3 { ... }               # same thing
</code></pre>

<p>There's a third way to write it too, and that's by using a function form:</p>

<pre><code>if $answer == any(1, 3) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>The two latter forms mean exactly the same thing; both create a <em>junction</em>, a scalar value masquerading as several different scalar values.</p>

<p>The main thing we'd want to use a junction for is to highlight what it is we want to calculate. It's often the case that we <em>could</em> write things out with a <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>my $matched = False;
for @candidates {
    if $answer == $_ {
        $matched = True;
        last;
    }
}
if $matched { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>But it's much easier to just "pack" the whole looping into a junction:</p>

<pre><code>if $answer == any(@candidates) { ... }   # same thing!
</code></pre>

<p>Under the hood, what happens with a junction is that several different alternatives are tried, and then the final result of the junction is extracted from that. With <code>any</code>, we want at least one alternative to evaluate to a true value; with <code>all</code>; we want all of them to yield something true.</p>

<p>You're free to think of <code>any</code> and <code>all</code> as running all of its alternatives in parallel and coming back with a result. That might actually come true sometime &mdash; things going off in sepearate threads and running concurrently &mdash; but right now it's just a possible future optimization.</p>

<p>Just to have this said: it's common for people to look at junctions, think they're really cool, and then expect them to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>if any(@contestants).won {
    # do something with the winner
}
</code></pre>

<p>But we can't. Junctions answer questions like "does <em>any</em> of these..." or "do <em>all</em> of these..."; they don't pick out the things that match or fail to match and hand them back to you. Their <em>purpose</em> is to treat several things as a unit. If you find you wanted to tease out values of that unit, what you wanted was probably something more like this:</p>

<pre><code>my $winner = @contestants.first({ .won });

if $winner {
    # do something with $winner
}
</code></pre>

<p>And with that, we're all set. See you tomorrow with more blogging.</p>
