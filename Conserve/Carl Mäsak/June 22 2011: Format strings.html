  <p>A big language like Perl is full of smaller languages; little helpers that carry out duties that the regular language would be able to do, but less simply and elegantly.</p>

<p>Today we'll see such a language. It's used for formatting strings.</p>

<pre><code>say sprintf "I have %d apples", 15;   # "I have 15 apples"
</code></pre>

<p>The new thing in the above are <code>sprintf</code>, the name of the subroutine that calls on the formatting language; and <code>%d</code>, a kind of placeholder for values. (The <code>d</code> stands for "decimal", so we're expecting the value to be printed as a base-10 integer.)</p>

<p>Ok, that's a start, but it doesn't give us much over <code>"I have $apples apples"</code> yet. What more do we have?</p>

<p>Well, look at this, for example:</p>

<pre><code>say sprintf "I have %05d apples", 15;   # "I have 00015 apples"
</code></pre>

<p>That extra <code>05</code> there tells <code>sprintf</code> to print the value using five characters, and to fill with <code>0</code>s if needed. Convenient.</p>

<p>Here's another convenient thing we can use it for:</p>

<pre><code>say "Thirds always give me trouble: ", 1/3
    # "Thirds always give me trouble: 0.333333333333333"

say sprintf "Thirds always give me trouble: %5.2f", 1/3
    # "Thirds always give me trouble:  0.33"
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas the <code>%d</code> is for integers, the <code>%f</code> is for floating-point values. (Since it's integers that are denoted by <code>%d</code>, it's probably best in this case not to think of non-integer numbers as "decimal numbers", which would be confusing.)</p>

<p>So. Any time you feel the need to round a number to two decimal places (or whatever) before printing it, don't reach for all manner of tricky arithmetic to do it. Reach for <code>sprintf</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, if it's only one single thing you want to format, there's a method to do that for you. And it's not called <code>.sprintf</code>, for once. It got a shorter name:</p>

<pre><code>say 42.fmt("%4d");    # "  42"
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>reason</em> it got a shorter name is that it can do a few tricks that <code>sprintf</code> can't:</p>

<pre><code>say [1, 2, 3].fmt("%5.2f");        # " 1.00  2.00  3.00"
say [1, 2, 3].fmt("%5.2f", ";");   # " 1.00; 2.00; 3.00"
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it not only formats scalar values, but lists and arrays, too. (And hashes.)</p>

<p>Now the only missing piece is learning what other things you can format besides integers and floating-point numbers. Here's a list of the most important ones:</p>

<pre><code>%s string
%d int
%x hexadecimal int
%X uppercase hexadecimal
%b binary int
%f float

% d int with a space before it
%+d int with a sign before it

%-8s left-justified string taking up 8 places
%08s string taking up 8 places, filled with 0s on the left
</code></pre>

<p>That's it for today.</p>

<p>Making code that outputs things look decent is notoriously hard. <code>sprintf</code> and <code>.fmt</code> at least help make the job a little easier. Don't forget to use them when you encounter a tricky formatting problem.</p>
