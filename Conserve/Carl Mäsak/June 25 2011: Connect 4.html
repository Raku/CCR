  <p>Today we'll implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_4">Connect 4</a>. In our version, it's played between players <code>X</code> and <code>O</code> on a 7 ⨯ 6 grid.</p>

<p>The game is a bit bigger than what we've seen so far, but all of the individual pieces are (mostly) straightforward. As usual, comments come at the end.</p>

<p>First, here's how the end of a game might look:</p>

<pre><code>|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   | X | O |   |   |   |
|   | O | X | X | X |   |   |
| O | X | O | X | O |   |   |
|---------------------------|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

Player O, your move: 6

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   | X | O |   |   |   |
|   | O | X | X | X |   |   |
| O | X | O | X | O | O |   |
|---------------------------|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

Player X, your move: 6

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   | X | O |   |   |   |
|   | O | X | X | X | X |   |
| O | X | O | X | O | O |   |
|---------------------------|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

Player X won.
Thanks for playing!

<p>Ok, lots to comment on here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Note how we create <code>@board</code>. It's an array of arrays (since the board is two-dimensional), so we construct it with a <code>map</code> of <code>map</code>s.</p></li>
<li><p><code>show_board</code> is straightforward. We're using our new friend <code>.fmt</code> to avoid a few <code>for</code> loops when representing each row.</p></li>
<li><p>We haven't seen <em>chained comparisons</em> before, as in <code>pile_height</code>, but they're easy: <code>0 &lt;= $column &lt; $WIDTH</code> simply means <code>0 &lt;= $column &amp;&amp; $column &lt; $WIDTH</code>. We're used to seeing this notation from maths.</p></li>
<li><p><code>unless</code> shows up a lot in this code, both in its block form and as a statement modifier. The cousin of <code>if</code>, it is most often used when we want to bail out of something because of broken preconditions. Thus we <code>die</code> in <code>pile_height</code> if an out-of-range <code>$column</code> was passed in, and we <code>return</code> early from <code>input_move</code> if the move entered isn't quite right.</p></li>
<li><p>Why do we <code>die</code> in one subroutine and <code>return</code> from another? Well, we want the game to keep running even if one of the players slips on the keyboard, so it makes sense to be a bit nicer in <code>input_move</code>. But <code>pile_height</code> is more of an "internal" routine, and a faulty parameter there usually means the whole program is wrong somehow. (This actually happened as I was writing the program.) So it makes sense to be more strict in <code>pile_height</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The subs <code>pile_is_full</code> and <code>board_is_full</code> are "unnecessary" in that we might as well have inlined the expressions they contained right in the code. But look what difference it makes to actually <em>define</em> those terms. Never underestimate the power of a good name for a concept.</p></li>
<li><p>Note how <code>$move - 1</code> happens here and there. This is the usual translation between player-facing coordinates (1-based) and array indices (0-based). It only happens for columns and not for rows, since those are not exposed to the player.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>was_win</code> subroutine checks all the possible straights that the move <em>could</em> have made. It doesn't check the whole board. For straights of length 4, it checks up to 16 possible straights. (4 vertical, 4 horizontal, and 8 diagonal.)</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that <code>was_win</code> defines four subroutines <em>inside</em> of itself. Those subroutines are purely for internal use by <code>was_win</code> &mdash; they're not even visible from the outside. They also cunningly use variables from outside of themselves; <code>$row</code> and <code>$column</code> are parameters to <code>was_win</code>, but are used within <code>was_vertical_win</code>, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, another variable that's used inside the subroutines but defined outside, is <code>@board</code>. It should figure as a parameter to <em>all</em> the subroutines in the program if we wanted to make them independent of their environment. It's slightly bad practice not to make it a parameter, because that code is now <em>coupled</em> to <code>@board</code>... but it was felt that it would hurt exposition too much to be 100% kosher in this case. Programming is full of trade-offs.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>uniform</code> subroutine inside of <code>was_win</code> contains two things that we haven't seen yet. <code>@values».defined</code> means the same as <code>map { .defined }, @values</code>; it's just a shorter way of writing it. <code>[eq] @values</code> tests all values in <code>@values</code> with the <code>eq</code> operator. In summary, the <code>uniform</code> function checks that all values in <code>@values</code> are defined (which happens when none of the coordinates was outside of the board), and that they're all string-equal (which happens when someone made a winning straight).</p></li>
<li><p>Notice how we use <code>map</code> in the <code>was_*_win</code> functions to translate from the "coordinates" 0..3 to actual positions along a line in <code>@board</code>. That should give a taste of how versatile <code>map</code> can actually be: we want to talk about the contents of the things on a line on the board, so we just transform 0..3 to that line.</p></li>
<li><p>Because we have put all of the nitty-gritty details in subroutines, the actual game loop is fairly short. Show the board, input a move, place a piece, check the two possible ending conditions, and switch player. And it reads well, too: <code>if board_is_full</code> &mdash; isn't that nice?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Phew! That's it for today. Now we're heading straight for our final goal: the text adventure game.</p>
