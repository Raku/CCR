  <p>Having learned how to create classes, we might go on to create them to our hearts' content:</p>

<pre><code>class Hammer {
    method hammer($stuff) {
        say "You hammer on $stuff. BAM BAM BAM!";
    }
}

class Gavel {
    method hammer($stuff) {
        say "You hammer on $stuff. BAM BAM BAM!";
    }
}

class Mallet {
    method hammer($stuff) {
        say "You hammer on $stuff. BAM BAM BAM!";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But... notice something here? These three classes contain the exact same method, repeated in each class. We <em>have</em> to do that if we want each of <code>Hammer</code>, <code>Gavel</code> and <code>Mallet</code> to have the ability to <code>hammer</code>. (And that's reasonable.) But it's a pity that we have to triplicate the method.</p>

<p>Why is it a pity? Well, it's more to write, for one thing. Also, the methods might not be this close to each other in a real-world example, and one day we may decide to change something in the <code>hammer</code> method, not realizing that it's in three different places... which generally leads to a bunch of pain and suffering.</p>

<p>So here we are, with this new toy, classes, and already they exhibit a problem. We'd somehow like to <em>re-use</em> the <code>hammer</code> method in each three classes.</p>

<p>A new concept, the <em>role</em> comes to our rescue:</p>

<pre><code>role Hammering {
    method hammer($stuff) {
        say "You hammer on $stuff. BAM BAM BAM!";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas classes are often named after an appropriate noun, roles are often named after a participle, such as <code>Hammering</code>. It's not a hard-and-fast rule, but it's a good rule of thumb. I really shouldn't be talking about thumbs, what with all the hammering going on...</p>

<p>Now the class definitions become easy:</p>

<pre><code>class Hammer does Hammering {}
class Gavel  does Hammering {}
class Mallet does Hammering {}
</code></pre>

<p>Ah, yes. We <em>like</em> that.</p>

<p>What's happening under the hood when we do <code>does</code> on a class? All the methods from the role definition are copied into the class definition. Since it's a copy operation, we can do it with as many classes as we want.</p>

<p>So, here's what we do: we put methods in roles when we figure we'll re-use them.</p>

<p>But that's not the only benefit we get. There's at least two more:</p>

<pre><code>my $hammer = Hammer.new;    # create a new hammer object
say $hammer ~~ Hammer;      # "Bool::True" -- yes, this we know
say $hammer ~~ Hammering;   # "Bool::True" -- ooh!
</code></pre>

<p>So the <code>$hammer</code> knows that it does <code>Hammering</code>. Essentially, we now have a way to ask not only what class an object belongs to, but also what roles it incorporates. That's useful if we're unsure what kind of object we're dealing with:</p>

<pre><code>if $unkown_object ~~ Hammering {
    $unknown_object.hammer("that nail over there");     # will always work
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can a class take on several roles at once? Yes, it can:</p>

<pre><code>role Flying {
    method fly {
        say "Whooosh!";
    }
}

class FlyingHammer does Hammering does Flying {}
</code></pre>

<p>Having a class do several roles in that way introduces an interesting possibility: that of <em>conflicts</em>, when two methods with the same name from two different roles try to occupy the same class. What happens in such a case? Well, there are at least three possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>First role wins. Its method gets to live in the class.</li>
<li>Last role wins. It overwrites the previous method.</li>
<li>Compilation fails. The conflict has to be resolved.</li>
</ol>

<p>And option 3 is the right answer in this case. The reason for this is the same as before: as classes and projects grow larger, the programmer might not <em>realize</em> that there's a conflict between two roles somewhere. So we flag it.</p>

<pre><code>role Sleeping {
    method lie {
        say "Reclining horizontally...";
    }
}

role Lying {
    method lie {
        say "Telling an untruth...";
    }
}

class SleepingLiar does Sleeping does Lying {}    # CONFLICT!
</code></pre>

<p>Next question, then: when there's a role conflict in a class, how do we fix it? Simple: by defining a method with that name in the class itself:</p>

<pre><code>class SleepingLiar does Sleeping does Lying {
    method lie {
        say "Lying in my sleep....";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to call a method from a particular role, there's a syntax for that:</p>

<pre><code>class SleepingLiar does Sleeping does Lying {
    method lie {
        self.Sleeping::lie;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And that's roles. They mix in reusable behavior into classes.</p>

<p>Now, we're finally ready to tackle that text adventure of ours!</p>
