  <p><code>if</code> statements are great, but after a while they start looking like this:</p>

<pre><code>my $animal = prompt "What's your favorite animal? ";

if ($animal eq "tiger") {
    say "Roar!";
}
elsif ($animal eq "cow") {
    say "Mooo!";
}
elsif ($animal eq "parrot") {
    say "Ka-kaw!";
}
elsif ($animal eq "butterfly") {
    say "*flap* *flap*";
}
else {
    say "I'm sorry, I do not know that animal.";
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's a lot of repetition in there:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lots of <code>if</code> and <code>elsif</code>.</li>
<li>Lots of <code>$animal eq</code>. We're checking the same variable all the time, and still we have to repeat that that's what we're doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's a construct that's specially designed to reduce this kind of needless "boilerplate" repetition: the <em>switch statement</em>, or <em><code>given</code> statement</em>. Here's how the same program would look using that:</p>

<pre><code>my $animal = prompt "What's your favorite animal? ";

given $animal {
    when "tiger"     { say "Roar!"; }
    when "cow"       { say "Mooo!"; }
    when "parrot"    { say "Ka-kaw!"; }
    when "butterfly" { say "*flap* *flap*"; }

    default { say "I'm sorry, I do not know that animal."; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way of writing takes less space, no doubt. Now, that's partly because we now write the <code>{ ... }</code> blocks on the same line as the condition &mdash; we could do that with the <code>if</code> statements and save some space that way, too. But it's much more accepted with the <code>given</code> statement.</p>

<p>The other big saving is that we now write <code>$animal</code> once at the top, and then no more. It's <em>implicit</em> that we're comparing <code>$animal</code> against <code>"tiger"</code> and <code>"cow"</code> and <code>"parrot"</code>... we don't need to state it and re-state it. Even the <code>eq</code> is now implicit.</p>

<p>Wait a minute! How <em>does</em> that work, really? We already know that there's a difference between numerical equivalence (<code>==</code>) and string equivalence (<code>eq</code>) &mdash; how does Perl 6 know which one to choose here?</p>

<p>It knows which one to choose by looking at the type of the thing it's comparing. So <code>"tiger"</code> causes a string comparison, whereas <code>42</code> would cause a numerical comparison. There's a special operator called <em>smartmatch</em>, which embodies this type-aware kind of comparison:</p>

<pre><code>say $answer ~~ "tiger";     # means '$answer eq "tiger"'    
say $answer ~~ 42;          # means '$answer == 42'
</code></pre>

<p>The smartmatch comes back again and again in Perl 6, even when you can't see it. For example, the <code>when</code> clauses above use smartmatching under the hood:</p>

<pre><code>when "cow" { ... }          # really means 'if $_ ~~ "cow" { ... }'
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>$_</code> variable there is a little darling. The fact that it doesn't start with a letter, but is just a dollar and an underscore, tells us that it's a somewhat special variable. Just like with smartmatches, the strength of <code>$_</code> is that it doesn't always have to be written out. We'll see more examples of that as we go along, but the <code>when</code> clause above is one such example.</p>

<p>Of course, this whole thing would only work if <code>$_</code> contained the value of <code>$animal</code> somehow... and that's exactly what <code>given</code> does for us. It (temporarily) sets <code>$_</code> to the value that we give it.</p>

<p>The extra little feature of <code>when</code> blocks is that when they match, they take you out of the surrounding <code>given</code> block. (Or more generally, the surrounding block that sets <code>$_</code>.) Same thing goes for the <code>default</code> block... which doesn't do much else, really. It always matches.</p>

<p>It's often the case that nifty features in Perl 6 are built up of smaller, simpler nifty features. The <code>given</code>/<code>when</code> statement is one such feature, as it turns out that it really uses <code>$_</code> and smartmatching underneath.</p>

<p>Now we're ready to tackle our next game. See you tomorrow on another celestial body.</p>
