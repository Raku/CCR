  <p>This summer when we started the November project, we chose <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> as our revision control system. During the past week, seeing how we have been effortlessly throwing around commits and branches — we're up to five right now — and generally being very productive in our environment, I think I'm not just learning to live with git, but actually starting to like it.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software">Wikipedia</a>) has this to say: "Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history."</p>

<p>One such tool is <a href="http://github.com/blog/39-say-hello-to-the-network-graph-visualizer">the network graph</a> at github. <a href="http://masak.org/carl/nonlinear-history.png">Here's a snapshot</a> of the last few days of development in November. Four of our five active branches are visible.</p>

<p>I've gotten into the habit of checking that graph regularly. Partly to see if anyone's committed anything new, but partly because seeing that graph is like getting a message from git, saying "here's all the complexity I'm handling for you automatically". Because, the thing is, doing branching and merging doesn't <em>feel</em> complicated. Branching and merging is rapid and painless, and has that <em>It Just Works</em> feeling to it.</p>

<p>As John Wiegley says in <a href="http://www.newartisans.com/blog_files/git.from.bottom.up.php">Git from the bottom up</a>, "Most other systems have led me to believe they've reached their conceptual plateau — that allelse from now will be only a slow refinement of what I’ve seen before. Git gives me the opposite impression, however. I feel we’ve only begun to see the potential its deceptively simple design promises."</p>

<p>Thanks, git.</p>
