    <h1><a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/notation-and-the-business-case-for-perl-6">Notation, and the 'business case' for Perl 6</a></h1>
  </header>

  <p>A few days before Christmas, I was sitting in the car with my father. I decided to try to explain why I'm spending time doing Perl 6.</p>

<p>I compared the evolution of programming languages with the evolution of mathematical notation. In maths, it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">tricky to imagine</a> the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero#Early_history">zero</a> before it was formalized down to a number; the idea of derivatives was tossed around in vague forms before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative">Newton and Leibniz</a> made notations for it; we slowly but surely got a standard way of saying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign">"is equal to"</a>. And so on.</p>

<p>I was just about to connect this back to how each new programming language can be seen as a contribution to an ongoing, open debate about notation within the programming world, one that has only been going on in earnest for half a century or so. But I never got that far, because my father interrupted me and asked what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_case">business case</a> is for Perl 6.</p>

<p>I was half stumped, half amused by this interjection. I didn't have a good answer for him, besides trying to explain FOSS and the fact that we're not developing Perl 6 with the expectation that someone will buy it from us. But I still felt he had a point; so, earlier today, I took the question to <code>#perl6</code>, and got a set of good <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-12-27#i_1871329">replies and musings</a> by Su-Shee++, moritz++, vorner++ and mdxi++. If you have time, do read it.</p>

<p>I'll have to give the 'business case' train-of-thought a lot more time to mature before I can say anything coherent about it myself. But I'd like to say a bit more about notations.</p>

<p>Perl 6 isn't truly revolutionary in a lot of respects. It's mostly lots and lots of minor improvements. (The exception being, I think, things surrounding grammars. Those are truly revolutionary.)</p>

<p>What Perl 6 does do, is provide a 'strangely consistent' notation where a lot of thoughts, with practice, are easy to express. This is very much in the Perl spirit, and the main reason (according to me) to still call Perl 6 a language in the Perl family.</p>

<p>The notational convenience really consists of a thousand little things, but here are a few haphazardly chosen examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>The prefix symbols <code>?</code>, <code>+</code> and <code>~</code> have been co-opted to signify conversion to the 'contexts' <code>Bool</code>, <code>Num</code> and <code>Str</code>, respectively. This parallels their use in binary (infix) operators specific to those contexts, such as <code>+</code>, <code>~</code>, <code>?&amp;</code>, <code>+&amp;</code>, and <code>~&amp;</code> </li>
<li>The three short and common verbs <code>is</code>, <code>has</code> and <code>does</code> all do useful work in the OO system. Not only that, but they are a good fit for what they do, and summarize both established and modern OO research.</li>
<li>Some syntactic/semantic features are re-used where you least expect it, reducing the total number of independent components in the language. The left-hand side of a list assignment uses the same signature mechanism as do routines. (I.e. the <code>(Bool $a, Int $b, Str $c)</code> in <code>my **(Bool $a, Int $b, Str $c)** = True, 42, 'foo';</code> is the same kind of beast as in <code>sub foo**(Bool $a, Int $b, Str $c)** { ... }</code>.) Smartmatching with <code>~~</code> is implicitly re-used in <code>when</code> expressions, and the <code>given</code>/<code>when</code> construct is re-used as the <code>CATCH</code> exception handling mechanism. And so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's things like these that I think make Perl 6 a convenient, attractive notation for thinking about programming. Seeing that notation come alive, and seeing people use it in cool new ways for amazing ends, is the main reason I spend time helping with Perl 6.</p>
