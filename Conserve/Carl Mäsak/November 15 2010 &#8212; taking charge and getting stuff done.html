  <p>102 years ago today, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi (慈禧太后)</a> passed away. She had ruled China for 47 years from "behind the curtains", going against imperial tradition forbidding women to engage in politics.</p>

<div class="quote">Selected by the Xianfeng Emperor as a concubine in her adolescence, she climbed the ranks of Xianfeng's harem and gave birth to a son who became the Tongzhi Emperor upon Xianfeng's death. Cixi ousted a group of regents appointed by the late emperor and assumed regency over her young son with the Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi then consolidated control and established near-absolute rule over the dynasty.</div>

<p>She has a generally bad reputation in the scrolls of history.</p>

<div class="quote">Historians from both <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang'>Kuomintang</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party'>Communist</a> backgrounds have generally portrayed her as a despot and villain responsible for the fall of the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty'>Qing Dynasty</a>, but in recent years other historians have suggested that she was a scapegoat for problems beyond her control, a leader no more ruthless than others, and even an effective if reluctant reformer in the last years of her life.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, her life is full of plotting and intrigue, something which no doubt tickles the mind of the historically curious. During her nephew <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxu_Emperor">Zaitian (載湉)</a>'s rule, Cixi had him put in house arrest for nine years. He died, 37 years old, on the day before Cixi passed away, apparently from arsenic poisoning.</p>

<p>To my surprise, the thing I meant to do today (converting November to work on Rakudo <code>ng</code>) had already been started. By me, no less. I had forgotten that.</p>

<p>Hm. Seems I did some initial work on it <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/step-1-on-the-road-to-recovery-admitting-you-have-a-problem">in relation to this post</a>, and then <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2010-04-09#i_2212685">continued that work</a> a few days later.</p>

<p>So where did that put me? I run <code>make</code> in the <code>ng-compat</code> branch of November to find out.</p>

<p>Ah. <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=73912">#73912</a> bites, and we get this bogus error message:</p>

<pre><code>===SORRY!===
Illegal redeclaration of symbol 'November'
</code></pre>

<p>Luckily, at some point pmichaud++ told me how to deal with this. (Can't find it in the backlog, but I remember him telling me.) The trick is to <a href="https://github.com/viklund/november/commit/d5b14b3c3ea9771e5160ef977c226f523ad81631">stub the class</a> before you start pulling in any modules that use that namespace:</p>

<pre><code>class November { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>That worked! Now November gets as far as pulling in <code>HTML::Template</code> which, amazingly, still compiles. These Makefiles are old enough that I need to manage <code>PERL6LIB</code> by hand &mdash; how barbaric.</p>

<p>Oh, and it turned out I needed to <a href="https://github.com/viklund/november/commit/590d5a74a3f0381d0449dc7eef221251e18488be">update the script <code>wiki</code></a>, responsible for actually running the November application. It had bitrotted from previous changes in module naming done in that branch.</p>

<p>Running <code>perl6 wiki</code>, this is what I get now:</p>

<pre><code>Cannot modify readonly value
  in '&amp;infix:&lt;=&gt;' at line 1
  in 'November::view_page' at line 53:lib/November.pm
  in &lt;anon&gt; at line 37:lib/November.pm
  in 'Dispatcher::Rule::apply' at line 44:lib/Dispatcher/Rule.pm
  in 'Dispatcher::dispatch' at line 37:lib/Dispatcher.pm
  in 'November::handle_request' at line 49:lib/November.pm
  in main program body at line 17:wiki
</code></pre>

<p>Probably Rakudo has become a bit more stringent with readonly things since alpha. This will provide a good starting point for tomorrow's investigations.</p>
