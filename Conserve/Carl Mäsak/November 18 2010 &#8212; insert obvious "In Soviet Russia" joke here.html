  <p>54 years ago today &mdash; and yes, we do seem to have a bit of a Communism theme going &mdash; then Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev said to a group of Western ambassadors "We will bury you!"</p>

<div class="quote">In fact, it was somewhat distorted. The actual quote reads: <strong>"Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will dig you in"</strong> (Нравится вам или нет, но история на нашей стороне. Мы вас закопаем).</div>

<p>Be that as it may, Google Translate doesn't suggest "dig you in", it says "bury".</p>

<p>Khrushchev appears to have been a hot-tempered Soviet leader. The kind of guy who sticks his chin out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe-banging_incident">bangs his shoe on the table</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuzma's_mother">says "Kuzka's mother"</a> to president Nixon. A few years later, Khrushchev mentions the "bury you" comment.</p>

<div class="quote">On August 24, 1963, Khrushchev himself remarked in his speech in Yugoslavia, "I once said, 'We will bury you,' and I got into trouble with it. Of course we will not bury you with a shovel. Your own working class will bury you," a reference to the Marxist saying, "The proletariat is the undertaker of capitalism", based on the concluding statement in Chapter 1 of the Communist Manifesto: "What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable".</div>

<p>The contrast between "the victory of the proletariat" and the two silent revolutions from <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/november-17-2010-suppression-and-regressions">yesterday</a> and <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/november-16-2010-the-polite-revolt">day before yesterday</a>, is nothing short of stark.</p>

<p>I also found <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867329,00.html">this lovely little Time article</a> about the "bury you" incident. It describes Krushchev working himself up into a rage and tramples around on several diplomatic feet.</p>

<div class="quote"><p>His voice was scornful as he added: "But we, Mister Capitalists, we are beginning to understand your methods."</p>

<p>By this time, the diplomats—who, in turn, have come to understand Mister Khrushchev's methods—had already left the room.</p></div>

<p>Didn't get started on a <code>.trans</code> patch today. <code>$WORK</code> got in the way, and before I knew it, it was time to cut a Rakudo release.</p>

<p>Right now I'm running the spectests one last time, taking the chance to write this blog post. It hasn't been very taxing to make the release this time either &mdash; especially not compared to last year, when <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/november-19-2009-a-feeling-of-power-a-feeling-of-release">the clock was ticking</a> &mdash; but I figure I should pace myself and save the <code>.trans</code> patch, or whatever, for tomorrow. Releasing Rakudo is definitely worth one day of November blogging.</p>

<p>I'll just add in passing that, a little over half-way through this Month of November, I'm having no trouble finding things to do every day. I expect to reach the end of the month feeling "what? no more November?" rather than "phew! finally over!".</p>

<p>Well, I'll probably feel a little bit of both. 哈哈 But my point is that there seems to be a lot to fill this month with. My main concern is that I might get "stuck" in any of my projects and devote too much time to that, to the detriment of the others.</p>

<p>And that's rather nice, as problems go. I'm glad I decided to do another month of November blogging.</p>
