  <p>2543 years ago today &mdash; assuming there was no <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2010-11-23#i_3025150">year 0</a> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thespis">Thespis of Icaria</a> won the first documented competition for Best Tragedy in Athens. Thespis is credited with the invention of acting out written plays.</p>

<div class="quote">Thespis of Icaria (present-day Dionysos, Greece) (6th century BC), according to certain Ancient Greek sources and especially Aristotle, was the first person ever to appear on stage as an actor playing a character in a play (instead of speaking as him or herself).</div>

<p>But having invented "pretending you're someone else on stage", he didn't stop there.</p>

<div class="quote">Capitalising on his success, Thespis also invented theatrical touring: he would tour various cities while carrying his costumes, masks and other props in a horse-drawn wagon (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Formella_15,_il_carro_di_Tespi_(Theatrica),_nino_pisano,_1334-1336.JPG">see picture</a>).</div>

<p>Historical documents are silent on whether he also had a manager.</p>

<p>We left off yesterday with garbled output:</p>

<pre><code>Are y u eager t  see Per  6  eing re eased, s  y u  an write      
pr grams in it with ut w rrying if the  anguage is "d ne" yet?
</code></pre>

<p>Some key letters are missing, incidentally all also part of the word <code>block</code>. (Though there was no <code>k</code> in the above sentence to begin with.) My guess, without having looked at the code yet, is that there's a <code>.trans</code> call somewhere, and that it accidentally stringifies a regex or some other <code>Callable</code>.</p>

<p>Looking...</p>

<p>Um. Ok. So... this is going to be a bit unsatisfactory, from the point of view of lucid explanations. The problem went away as I diagnosed it.</p>

<p>Here are the details: there appears to be no piece of code actually causing this problem. In fact, I commented out the whole <code>Text::Markup::Wiki::MediaWiki</code> code path, and things <em>still</em> failed. At this point, I was a bit mystified.</p>

<p>In November (the wiki engine), we've introduced a <em>cache</em>, in order to speed up page generation. The cache stores the HTML generated from the source markup, and as I looked at the appropriate file in that cache, it looked broken in exactly the above way.</p>

<p>So I cleared the cache. And the problem went away.</p>

<p>The text looks OK now. But it doesn't generate HTML any more at all. It just spits out the original Mediawiki markup. And I have no idea why. (And yes, I did revert the change that turned off the <code>Text::Markup::Wiki::MediaWiki</code> code path.)</p>

<p>An excellent place to start investigating tomorrow.</p>
