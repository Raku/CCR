  <p>149 years ago today, Charles Darwin published a book called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species">On the Origin of Species</a>, also known as "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species#Publication_of_On_The_Origin_of_Species">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote><div><p>The second edition of 3,000 copies was quickly brought out on 7 January 1860, and added "by the Creator" into the closing sentence, so that from then on it read "There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved." While some commentators, such as Richard Dawkins, have taken this as an indication that Darwin was bowing to pressure to make concessions to religion, biographer James Moore describes Darwin's vision as being of God creating life through the laws of nature.</p></div></blockquote>

<p>Seems like undercurrents of ID were with us from the beginning...</p>

<p>Today I had so much fun creating the first skin for November, that I almost forgot to blog. I'd love to show it to you, but unfortunately my "It Just Works" Apple Macintosh won't let me take screenshots today, and I can't figure out why. I guess I could clone the whole thing into a static HTML page and upload it somewhere, but that hardly seems worth the trouble. Instead, I merged my work so far into the master branch. <a href="http://github.com/viklund/november/">Download that</a> and have a look. ☺</p>

<p>No, I'm not tricking you into downloading our wiki engine. I just want you to take a look at the new layout I made. Afterwards, you can delete the whole directory if you want. Or look around a bit at the cool Perl 6 source code. Whatever.</p>

<p>Short instructions: after you've downloaded November, enter the <code>p5w</code> directory and execute the command <code>./wiki</code>. It will tell you where to surf next to see the new layout.</p>

<p>Good luck! Let me know what you think.</p>
