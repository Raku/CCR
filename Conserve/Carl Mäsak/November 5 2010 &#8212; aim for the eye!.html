  <p>454 years ago today, the (second) Battle of Panipat was joined in northern India. The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Panipat_(1556)'>Wikipedia entry</a> could use some editing, but here's the interesting strategic part of the battle:</p>

<div class="quote">It seemed Hemu was on a winning track and Akbar's army would rout. However, Khan Zaman I, the veteran of many a wars and an able general had planned otherwise. With a much smaller army, his plan was clear. The warriors of that time, including Hemu wore armour completely covering their body specially the vulnerable organs except the eyes. After repeated attempts a stray arrow struck Hemu's eye and he was knocked down senseless, almost dead in his <em>howda</em> (elephant seat) on the elephant. Not seeing Hemu in his howda, Hemu’s army was in disarray and defeated in the ensuing confusion.</div>

<p>Some nice things about this: (1) they were using elephants in battle, that's got to look impressive; (2) one of the combatants is named Akbar. But he's on the winning side, so it does not make much sense for him to yell <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral_Ackbar#Popular_culture">"it's a trap!"</a>. Neither was he a admiral; he was an emperor.</p>

<p class='separator'>&#10086;</p>

<p>Instead of taking eight minutes to munch generate stuff for my blog, my static page generator now takes slightly above three minutes.</p>

<p>The change I made is adding in this subroutine, which returns <code>True</code> if a given <code>$target</code> file doesn't exist, or if it is older than its corresponding <code>$source</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>sub nonexistent-or-older($target, :than($source)!) {
    return $target.IO !~~ :e
           || $target.IO.changed before $source.IO.changed;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I especially like the last line. I read it out loud as "or target IO changed before source IO changed", which is pretty much what the code is doing. I took a <em>teeny</em> bit of a liberty in using <code>before</code> rather than <code>&lt;</code>, because it reads better. Generally I don't like that kind of catering to English-like code, but here it seemed too good to resist. Note that I kept <code>||</code> in favor of <code>or</code> &mdash; even I have my limits.</p>

<p>Anyway, it turned out that the subroutine was generalized and lost its pretty perfectly-readable last line; some files like <code>index.html</code> and <code>feed.atom</code> are composed from several source files, and they all need to be checked against the target. So the final version I ended up with was this:</p>

<pre><code>sub nonexistent-or-older($target, :than(@sources)!) {
    return $target.IO !~~ :e
           || any map { $target.IO.changed before $_.IO.changed }, @sources;
}
</code></pre>

<p>[<strong>Addendum:</strong> sorear++ points out that I should be writing the above as <code>$target.IO.changed before any(@sources).IO.changed</code>. Clearly that's what the above code <em>wants</em> to look like, platonically speaking. And we're back at extreme readability. I have much to learn still about the wonders of Perl 6.]</p>

<p>Much of the work that remains with <code>psyde</code> is pushing calls such as this into a data structure so that whatever code the user produces, things like this will be called automatically. Right now I do it manually, and my <code>psyde</code> script is ~200 lines long. When everything is stacked neatly into an API, I might get away with as little as ~40. Maybe less.</p>
