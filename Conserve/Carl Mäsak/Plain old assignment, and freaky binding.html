  <p>What happens when we do assignment? When we do <code>$a = 42;</code>, for example.</p>

<p>Intuitively, in almost every language, what happens is at least something like this: the <em>symbol</em> <code>$a</code> becomes associated with the <em>value</em> <code>42</code>. In pseudo instruction code, it might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code> <strong>my $a; $a = 42;</strong>     $0 = 42
    store '$a', $0</code></pre>

<p>(Feel free to read <code>$0</code> et al. as "some register in the VM". And to fantasize liberally about the opcodes.)</p>

<p>From this model, we expect variables to be independent, even when we've assigned from one to the other. So in this piece of code...</p>

<pre><code> <strong>my $a = 42; my $b = $a; $a = 5;</strong> 
    $0 = 42
    store '$a', $0
    $1 = fetch '$a'
    store '$b', $1
    $2 = 5
    store '$a', $2</code></pre>

<p>...we expect <code>$b</code> to still be associated with the value <code>42</code>, and not to have suffered some freaky action-at-a-distance which causes it to be changed when <code>$a</code> is assigned to <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>"Well, obviously <code>$b</code> won't do that", you interject. "It can't, if we believe in the model in which there are only symbols and their associated values. No freaky action-at-a-distance can occur." And that's right, as far as that goes.</p>

<p>But it turns out that Perl 6 allows a middle abstraction layer between symbols and values. The entities occupying this middle layer are usually referred to as "containers", but that's a terribly overloaded term. I'll call them "buckets" in this post, hoping I won't throw some hash expert into a fit. 哈哈</p>

<p>To explain the behavior of (and need for) buckets, let's take an almost identical example as the one above:</p>

<pre><code> <strong>my $a = 42; my $b := $a; $a = 5;</strong> 
    $0 = 42
    store '$a', $0
    bind '$b', '$a'
    $1 = 5
    store '$a', $1</code></pre>

<p>(Note the two surface differences from the earlier example: <code>:=</code> rather than <code>=</code>, and <code>bind</code> rather than <code>assign</code>.)</p>

<p>The state at the end of this new program <em>is</em> a case of freaky action-at-a-distance. When the value of <code>$a</code> is changed to <code>5</code> in the last statement, the value of <code>$b</code> will also be changed to <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>The reason for this is simple: the <code>:=</code> (and the <code>bind</code>) causes the symbol <code>$b</code> not to have a bucket all of its own, but to acquire <code>$a</code>'s bucket. When <code>5</code> is subsequently stored in that bucket, both <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> are simultaneously affected, since the two symbols share one and the same bucket.</p>

<p>Now as a language feature, freaky action-at-a-distance may at first seem to be situated somewhere on a spectrum between "useless" and "dangerous". But it is the feature that makes pass-by-reference parameter passing work:</p>

<pre><code>my $a = 42;
foo($a); # freaky!
say $a;  # 5

sub foo($b is rw) {
    $b = 5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note how that's practically the same example as the above with binding, except that it's now mediated through a layer of parameter passing. But <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> still share one single bucket, as before.</p>

<p>I only have two more things to say about this. First, jnthn++ explained in Copenhagen that the difference between scalar bucket and an array/hash bucket is that the former always forwards method calls to the value it contains. I don't grok that yet, so I may have got it wrong.</p>

<p>Second, there's still a way to circumvent buckets, assigning values directly to symbols:</p>

<pre><code> <strong>my $a := 42;</strong> 
    $0 = 42
    bind '$a', $0</code></pre>

<p>What this means is simply that the variable <code>$a</code> is bound directly to a value, and has no buckets to which one can assign new values. It's a bit like a read-only value, except that <code>$a</code> can still be rebound to something else.</p>

<p>These are the kinds of thoughts one gets when starting to write a time-travelling debugger.</p>
