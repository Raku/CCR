  <p>Not having access to time travel, it's nevertheless nice to sometimes meet
people who seem to be on similar life paths, but later or earlier on the track.</p>

<p>Last week I chanced upon a 14yo boy who spent his days with a laptop, but
only playing games and watching YouTube vieos about games. Somehow he hadn't
started into programming. So I decided to show him some stuff. I spent an
evening showing nice Perl 6 features, and we ended up talking about which
languages to look into.</p>

<p>On my way back home from vacation, I wrote him an email to summarize what we
had talked about. I thought I'd share it with you.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why I start out mentioning C++ and Pascal explicitly
&mdash; that does seem rather odd, doesn't it? &mdash; it's because he had
heard about them before and was wondering whether they were any good.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just wanted to mostly repeat in an email the various pieces of
advice I left you with a few evenings ago.</p>

<p>First off: programming is pretty great. You make computers do whatever
you want. If you learn it well enough, you will have a place on the
job market. If you become excellent at it, people will pay you well.
That's not so bad.</p>

<p>It's up to you to find the language or languages you prefer. But I can
give some tips and pointers.</p>

<p>C++ is very important in some parts of the industry. It's fast and
well-established. But. It is not a beautiful language. It's not a good
beginner language. It's not a language that people grow to love.</p>

<p>Pascal was used for a long time in education. Java eventually
supplanted it. Pascal was very clean and simple for its time. I
believe today Pascal is a bit old and uninteresting. Doing Java or C#
is much preferable.</p>

<p>I believe you would do well to find one language each out of the
following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Problem-solving languages</li>
<li>Industrial languages</li>
<li>Magical languages</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem-solving languages are sometimes known as "scripting
languages". Perl, PHP, Ruby, Python, Lua, and others are in this
category. Learn them well, and you will be able to solve a whole host
of problems in no more than 20 lines of code, which you can write in
10 minutes. Here's a guy who wants to know when Friday the 13th occurs
in the next five years:
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/2012/07/yet-another-friday-the-13th.html#comment-175266">http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/2012/07/yet-another-friday-the-13th.html#comment-175266</a>.
Nine lines of Perl code, and he gets the answer. That's highly useful.</p>

<p>Today in 2012, the industrial languages are C# and Java. Many people
learn these at school and then go out and use them in their
professional life. They are a little bit boring but they are very
wide-spread, and knowing at least one of them is useful in today's
world. Programs will be longer and less elegant than in the
problem-solving languages, but there is more demand for these
languages. I find I often "think" in the shorter scripting languages
and then just translate to these industrial ones. Also, learning C
well pays off because then you better understand how a computer works,
and you will write more efficient Java or C# for it. (C pointers are
unnatural at first, and your programs <em>will</em> segfault, even though
most OSes survive that nowadays. It's trading away safety for
speed.)</p>

<p>Finally, the magical languages are the ones that change the way you
think about computers and programming. The ones in the LISP family are
magical languages. Common Lisp is more established (for a LISP) but
Scheme is cleaner and more minimal. LISPs are written in themselves,
which is way cool. They call this "metacircularity". Means you can
change anything you want. Don't mind the people who joke about all the
parentheses, they don't get it. Smalltalk is another magical language.
I'd recommend Squeak as a great learning environment. It's completely
reflective, which again means you can find and change anything.</p>

<p>A few further points of possible interest:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>JavaScript won't go away anytime soon. It is the language of the
web. It's not perfect, but it's good enough. Learn it.</p></li>
<li><p>Perl people like me don't always think highly of PHP, but the fact
remains that a many web applications today run on it. And it's not so
hard to learn. My advice is learn it, but also try and learn why Perl
is a better long-term alternative. ☺</p></li>
<li><p>Forth and Prolog are both candidates for the magical languages
category. Maybe check them out. Languages in the APL family are
bordering on magical, taking a "calculator approach" to solving
problems. The modern APL languages are called J and K.</p></li>
<li><p>It doesn't really matter if you pick up Python or Ruby or Perl. They
are all very decent scripting languages. Syntax debates over whether
curly braces or 'do' blocks or indentation are better are mostly a
waste of time.</p></li>
<li><p>It's completely OK to goof off for 10 years and just write whatever
the heck you feel like. Get real programming experience. After 10
years, you can start to think about <em>why</em> some things work better than
others.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux is generally a nicer programmer environment than Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Check out Rosetta Code for a nice-and-easy way to compare different
languages and their solutions to problems. Also has a nice collection
of problems. :)</p></li>
<li><p>You will learn faster if you go online and talk with other
programmers. IRC is nice for that. I'm always on irc.freenode.net if
you need something. Find a community you like, learn from them, and
learn to ask good questions so people will help you .</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could start listing books, but it's easier just to link to something
like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194812/list-of-freely-available-programming-books">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194812/list-of-freely-available-programming-books</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
