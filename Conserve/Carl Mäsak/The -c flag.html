    <h1><a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/the-c-flag">The -c flag</a></h1>
  </header>

  <p>The p6cc contest is underway. Yay.</p>

<p>[Coke]++ discovered on the channel that Rakudo nom didn't have a <code>-c</code> flag. The five <code>base-test</code> files all syntax-check the corresponding <code>code</code> files using the <code>-c</code> flag. Which made Rakudo nom and the <code>base-test</code> files incompatible. Oh noes.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;moritz&gt; moritz-- # not reviewing the test harness properly
</code></pre>

<p>The fault is even more mine, of course, since I <em>wrote</em> the test harness. And I may be an "early adopter" with Perl 6, but I'm always very late at switching over to a new Rakudo branch.</p>

<p>I was late at switching over to <code>ng</code>, back when it was still called <code>ng</code>. And I'm late this time in switching over from <code>b</code> (the new name for <code>ng</code>, since the <code>n</code> stands for "new" and <code>ng</code> isn't new anymore) to <code>nom</code> (the new "new").</p>

<p>I'll take the leap any day now, I promise.</p>

<p>moritz++ was quick in patching up the <code>-c</code> omission.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dalek&gt; rakudo/nom: a9bead6 | moritz++ | src/ (2 files):
&lt;dalek&gt; rakudo/nom: reimplement -c command line option
&lt;dalek&gt; rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a9bead6d48
&lt;moritz&gt; masak: there you go
&lt;masak&gt; moritz++
</code></pre>

<p>What this means in practice is: you can't use the latest Rakudo nom compiler release to solve the p6cc problems. Not without modifying the <code>base-test</code> files anyway. But you <em>can</em> use the bleeding-edge git checkout of the nom branch.</p>

<p>If you're on either Niecza or Rakudo b, things should be fine: those have a working <code>-c</code> flag already.</p>

<p>Those are the breaks. Perl 6 is evolving, and the mat is constantly being pulled out from under us. To keep up, one has to do a jig now and then.</p>

<p>We added a <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2011/NOTES"><code>NOTES</code></a> file to keep track of information of this kind that we didn't manage to get into the contest instructions.</p>

<p>On the channel, we also had some nice concluding discussion about the nature of the <code>-c</code> flag.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;moritz&gt; to me it felt a bit like a cheat
&lt;moritz&gt; because there is already some mechanism for specifying the target stage
&lt;moritz&gt; but it's too tightly coupled to the output from the existing stages to
         be easily usable
&lt;moritz&gt; so I feel like hijacking an existing mechanism
&lt;masak&gt; I guess.
&lt;masak&gt; in some sense, "checking syntax" isn't so much of a compiler stage as...
        a decision not to go past a certain compiler stage.
&lt;TimToady&gt; in a sense, -c adds the final CHECK, that just exits with status
&lt;masak&gt; right.
&lt;TimToady&gt; it can even be implemented that way, since CHECKS do lifo order
&lt;masak&gt; "everything turns out to be yet another setting" :)
&lt;TimToady&gt; yes, it could also be done with a variant setting, but that seems
           a bit heavyweight
&lt;TimToady&gt; otoh, it would be possible to sneak CHECK pushes in before the -c,
           so maybe a setting is the cleaner way
