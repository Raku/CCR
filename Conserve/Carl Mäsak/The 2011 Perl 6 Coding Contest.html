  </header>

  <p>With slightly less gratuitous buildup of expectations this year, but with no less grandeur and excitement, we're proud to announce:</p>

<p><center><strong>The 2011 Perl 6 Coding Contest</strong></center></p>

<p>Today there's two of us arranging the contest: the esteemed <a href="http://perlgeek.de/">Moritz Lenz</a>, and me. Hello.</p>

<p>This is a contest for people who <em>are</em> aware that Perl 6 has been "officially released", and who want the perfect excuse to start playing around with the language. As the Perl 6 community steadily works its way towards production-readiness, we can already enjoy ourselves royally by solving interesting Computer Science problems!</p>

<p>Here's the deal:</p>

<p><center><strong>do five tasks, and you might win Amazon books worth &euro;100!</strong></center></p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Thanks to an anonymous donor, we're very happy to announce that there is now a <em>second</em> prize too: Amazon books worth 100 USD!</p>

<p>The contest starts <em>now</em>, today on 2011-12-25. It ends five weeks later, on 2012-01-29. Registration is open for two weeks, starting <em>now</em>. Just send an email to <code>cmasak@gmail.com</code> &mdash; saying "sign me up!" or even sending your Amazon wishlist so we'll know which books to buy you if you win.</p>

<p>You might be curious about what you need to do to win. Here's an extract from the file <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2011/RULES"><code>RULES</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>Since "code quality" is a slightly subjective measure, let us provide a few
hints of what we'll be looking for:

* Correctness.
* Readability.
* Consistency.
* Clarity of intent.
* Algorithmic efficiency.
* Idiomatic use of Perl 6.
* Brevity.

In short, what we're looking for is top-quality code. That's how you win.
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the five tasks. Write Perl 6 programs to...</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a way to express an integer as an expression containing four 9s. (<a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2011/t1-description">more</a>)</li>
<li>List the numbers which are sums of cubes in more ways than one. (<a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2011/t2-description">more</a>)</li>
<li>Calculate addition chains. (<a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2011/t3-description">more</a>)</li>
<li>Slide a hex-shaped piece across a board. (<a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2011/t4-description">more</a>)</li>
<li>List all possible trees of a certain type. (<a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2011/t5-description">more</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>We've chosen the problems so that they're easy to explain, but allow contestants
quite a bit of freedom to play around with various solutions.</p>

<p>If you're curious about the details of the contest, I recommend the file <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2011/RULES"><code>RULES</code></a>. For easy downloading, here's <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2011/contest.zip">a .zip file</a> of everything you need for the contest.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> For useful afterthoughts, we've decided to keep a file <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2011/NOTES"><code>NOTES</code></a> around. Think of it as useful clarifications to the existing files in the repo. We won't pass or fail people based on things found in <code>NOTES</code>, but the items may help you with the tasks.</p>

<p>The rest is up to you. Hope hear from you &mdash; we <em>want</em> you to win those books!</p>
