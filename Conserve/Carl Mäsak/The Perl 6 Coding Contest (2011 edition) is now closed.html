  <div class='quote'><code>"Thanks for organizing the contest. Staying awake until 3am trying to make my solutions work (and trying to write them in a perl6ish way) was big fun! :)"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; one of the contestants </code></div>

<p>Ding! Pencils down.</p>

<p>So, here we are, five weeks later. Let's sum up:</p>

<ul>
<li>35 people signed up as contestants this year.</li>
<li>6 contestants submitted solutions.</li>
<li>27 submissions passed a <code>base-test</code> run and were accepted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last year's figures for the same things are (18, 5, 26), so somehow we ended up with many more contestants and only one more submission this year. That's fine; we know that the step from signing up to actually sending something in is quite a big one to take. Very interested to get feedback on how to make that step easier, though.</p>

<p>Just as last year, we'll synchronously publish people's solutions for each task in sequence, along with a blog post about the task and its solutions.</p>

<p>Unlike last year, I won't promise that these posts will be forthcoming in "the next few days/weeks". Last year it took over two months to process everything and get to the winner. Let's aim for one month this time &mdash; we're as expectant as you are to see solutions, blog post explanations, and an eventual winner!</p>

<p>Let's do this! First up: "Four 9s."</p>
