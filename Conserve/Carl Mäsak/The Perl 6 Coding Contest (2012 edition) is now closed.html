  <div class='quote'><code>"I've found this year the tasks were harder, but I've also spend more time thinking about the problems and less worrying about bugs in the interpreter... which is definitely good."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; a contestant</code></div>

<div class='quote'><code>"This year's problems were a lot more approachable to me and motivated me to learn more perl6."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; another contestant</code></div>

<p>...aaaand we're done. The five weeks are up.</p>

<p>I'm now all caught up processing submissions sent to me. So let's summarize, as usual:</p>

<ul>
<li>32 people signed up as contestants this year.</li>
<li>8 contestants submitted solutions.</li>
<li>24 submissions passed a <code>base-test</code> run and were accepted.</li>
</ul>

<p>These figures during p6cc2010 and p6cc2011 were (18, 5, 26) and (35, 6, 27), respectively. So all in all, it seems that we've entered a steady state both in terms of contestants and submissions. I'm grateful to get so much interesting Perl 6 code to read through and review.</p>

<p>Many people told me this year that they had noble plans to send in lots of solutions, but in the end didn't find the time for it. I'm assuming many contestants I haven't heard from have similar stories. That's fine; the contest is designed to encourage you to do the tasks, but not to force you to. If the contest made you take a look at the tasks, or at Perl 6, then in some sense that's a win, too.</p>

<p>My plan is, just like previous years, to go through the five tasks in order, publish all the reviews and an appropriately thoughtful blog post that summarizes the tasks and its solutions. With luck, we'll all learn something together.</p>

<p>It takes time to do these reviews. Sometimes a lot of time. That said, I hope to get through these submissions quickly. Expect something like a post each week. That's the goal.</p>

<p>After which I'll sum up and select a winner, also in a blog post. Exciting!</p>

<p>So, expect the next blog post to be about the first task: "Tell knights from knaves based on what they say." Onwards!</p>
