<p>Time's up.</p>

<p>The deadline was two days ago, and earlier today I processed the last couple of submissions. Here is the final tally:</p>

<ul>
<li>18 people signed up for the contest.</li>
<li>5 people submitted solutions.</li>
<li>26 submissions passed a <code>base-test</code> run and were accepted.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions are all over the place. It'll be a tough one to judge, but not impossible. Some solutions already stand out as exceptional. There are quite a few idioms in there that I hadn't seen before &mdash; and I keep discovering new ones.</p>

<p>Here's what I'll be doing in the next few days/weeks: for each task, I'll be putting together a blog post with discussion and code review, along with general discussion about efficiency and aesthetics. Consider it a five-episode series of being spoon-fed the best parts various solutions, with me doing the heavy chewing beforehand.</p>

<p>(Or, um, don't. That's a really gross metaphor. Eww! I should blog more often, and not let my mental analogy engine rust like this.)</p>

<p>Along with each blog post about a particular task, I'll also be putting up full listings of all sent-in solutions for that task. So you'll be able to browse around on your own and pick out the good parts and the bad.</p>

<p>So we'll have the walk-through of the five tasks, and <em>then</em> I'll announce the winner. This seems to have been <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2011-01-16#i_3190851">what the people wanted</a>, and I'm happy to oblige.</p>

<p>All clear? If so, next up will be task 1: "Find the optimal way to multiply a chain of matrices"!</p>
