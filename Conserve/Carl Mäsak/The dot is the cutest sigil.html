    <h1><a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/the-dot-is-the-cutest-sigil">The dot is the cutest sigil</a></h1>
  </header>

  <p>I've recently gotten into this style of programming:</p>

<pre><code>given %some-hash {
    if .&lt;foo&gt; {
        .&lt;bar&gt; = .&lt;baz&gt; + .&lt;austria&gt;;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I keep thinking of it as a wonky kind of sigil, the <code>.&lt;&gt;</code> sigil, which has its very own variable namespace inside of the hash I've chosen as topic.</p>

<p>Now let's say that the above piece of code was part of a prototyped program which later evolved to use objects instead of sloppy hashes. Then the same code becomes even nicer:</p>

<pre><code>given $some-object {
    if .foo {
        .bar = .baz + .austria;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The advantages of objects to hashes are immediate (and well-known):</p>

<ul>
<li>Less to write.</li>
<li>The translation between the old style and the new is automatic. Just remove the pointy elbows.</li>
<li>Spelling errors are now caught at runtime, as opposed to never.</li>
<li>The reason assignments (like the assignment to <code>.bar</code> above) work is that attribute accessors can be made <code>rw</code>. The flip side of that is that one can omit the <code>rw</code> and avoid assignment accidents. That's also an improvement over the hash.</li>
<li>Now the dot really looks like a cute little sigil. It isn't, of course, it's still the call-public-method twigil we know and love. But it's even easier to pretend that the attributes are special variables namespaced under the chosen object.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this is fairly trivial; I just think it's a nice syntax. But it is with this example that the truth finally sinks in: <em>keeping <code>$_</code> and <code>self</code> separate from each other in Perl 6 was a really good idea</em>.</p>

<p>With the syntax Perl 6 settled on, it's like there are two topics in a method: the common one (<code>$_</code>), and the OO one (<code>self</code>). And each has wonderful shortcuts: with <code>$_</code> you just use <code>prefix:&lt;.&gt;</code> as above, and with <code>self</code>, you can use <code>$.</code> or <code>@.</code> or <code>%.</code> ad lib. The OO form is slightly longer than the common form, since OO is more intricate (and less ubiquitous).</p>

<pre><code>Long form     Short forms
=========     ===========
$_.foo        .foo

self.foo      $.foo
              @.foo
              %.foo
</code></pre>

<p>And since they're disjunct from each other, you never have to context-switch or worry about what it is you're looking at when you see <code>.foo</code>. Unless you explicitly mix the two together with <code>given self</code> or invocant <code>$_</code> which you're entirely free to do, but remember that it only buys you one character.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, we can now re-write the code example in the <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/rfc/342.html">rejected rfc 342</a> so that it works in today's Perl 6, without introducing extra syntax:</p>

<pre><code>my $record = loadrecord($studentID);
given $record {
    my $spam = open .minimum;
    $spam.say: qq:to'SPAM';
    Dear {.name}:
            Your tuition is now due.  Please send in a payment
    of at least {.minimum}.
    SPAM
};
</code></pre>
