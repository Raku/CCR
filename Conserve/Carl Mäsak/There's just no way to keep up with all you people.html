  <p>Let's look at a week two years ago in the perl6 RT queue. Who submitted bugs?</p>

<p>Seems I just managed to tie with Moritz++ there. Almost one ticket a day sounds about right from what I remember of my submit pace from that time. In total, there were 16 tickets in that week.</p>

<p>Ok, that was two years ago. What about one year ago? By this time, Rakudo had already picked up a bit of a reputation.</p>

<p>Dang, only five tickets that week. 哈哈</p>

<p>Still, a pretty typical week. 25 tickets all in all. We see a bit more variation in the names now. That's the new people.</p>

<p>Finally, let's look at last week:</p>

<p>These figures help express what I feel. I'm still submitting a fair amount of tickets — all of nine last week — and still they make up an ever-smaller proportion of the growing deluge of perl6 tickets on RT.</p>

<p>Or, put differently, all you other people finally caught up with me. I can no longer compete with the rest of you. 哈哈</p>

<p>It makes me proud and excited to disappear under the waves of other people's contributions. There's been both a slow buildup over the past two years, and a sudden spike thanks to Rakudo Star. Together, they help drown out my insistent, repeating splashes on RT.</p>

<p>Rakudobugs are love. There's a whole lotta love out there right now. ♥ This uptake is what we've been waiting for.</p>
