  <p>My projects are rotting. Fast.</p>

<p>The really big change was the transition to a new Rakudo (known as <code>ng</code>) in January, of course. I was one of the people who stuck to the old Rakudo (known, retroactively, as <code>alpha</code>) for the longest time, because</p>

<ul>
<li>at first, <code>alpha</code> simply won in terms of features, and it wasn't feasible to apply workarounds to make code work in <code>ng</code>;</li>
<li>at some point in the middle, it was simply a relief to be coding in <code>alpha</code> and not having the carpet move under me for a while;</li>
<li>finally, at the point where <code>ng</code> started to significantly overtake <code>alpha</code>, it was the hugeness of the task that daunted.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, I've ported over GGE (grammar engine) and Yapsi (Perl 6 implementation). Projects that remain to be ported over include November (wiki engine), Web.pm (web framework), perl6-literate (runnable blog posts), pun (-n and -p flags for Rakudo), and Tardis (time-traveling debugger).</p>

<p>I ported GGE from <code>alpha</code> to <code>ng</code> on and off over a long period of time. Without the test coverage I have for that project, I probably would have given up. Just to give you an idea of the amount of work it was, the changes to bring GGE from <code>alpha</code> to <code>ng</code> can be found <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/839bd22dd4745679cb393f1d751df67d1e9560c9">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/c2a3496ea29f7a050a64b2c86444cd1626133af3">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/99ee4358bf610aaf05a9bc032c869b5b10ed30dc">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/18bf009e163ae40b282424612d84e13cc2dc4cb0">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/5f369ef4a077280231b7e165217d440ca00ab865">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/29b63609b710e7b4e44274682bf07b1d9fd32efc">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/e55d0e940b53466d4f792e1f335df7c62f98f033">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/131525a3523736a651ef0c303a04672526bebf4d">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/f9583814381b4f5321cc886aa8d8c3bd040b7821">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/3f4bdd40afa49896988c880547f52e3f37355ace">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/686e6ed28bd756f77651897323a7236ea1765370">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/e87e6a6bb6c08f6a799a66a4d0c1b16f9ba46406">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/d15321558aea55c98daf8a6edfe04a5bae6e323e">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/beae32c8ab3eeff940995a613bc4344c30b2e090">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/d8ff454d6f6f1abb4c3e4c0d767f90e8dd8a3c26">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/a38e8dbb76a500dab321474e3f746bbd209e0b4e">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/71c611a572bcfcda31a9646e2e6378156aeef833">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/e263efb4082477a4622e5f6f01aaea20d2d66499">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/7a77cf0b95256e095cead3e98672bd19075f39a6">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/712f2a028a5ee3ee9b10a2c0dcb061585033ad04">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/20751713def6d551064baf19efcb7c64211367c9">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/fa43d233bc0f3f2d1e97b981553bfb0dddca01d8">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/466b14fe91b51abf6ff8c06ba4e28ccb5c7ec734">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/8677a652791bce4cc76d3859f000dc76240686fd">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/7a46c16f9ea71d235358daf042546912818d607f">here</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/commit/59215db56827ba38b933258d9577ba91ac0335ea">here</a>. For those who want just the good bits already picked out, I once wrote a <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/gge-now-runs-fine-on-rakudo-master">blog post</a> on the lessons of porting GGE.</p>

<p>I ported Yapsi from <code>alpha</code> to <code>ng</code> mainly by rewriting the whole of Yapsi over the course of a few days. The change went in as a <a href="http://github.com/masak/yapsi/commit/62ff73d804541505edd65adb3cced9f9255bfdd2">single commit</a> declaring that "Yapsi now has a new Yapsi". Fitting, since Rakudo now had a new Rakudo.</p>

<p>I've started porting Druid from <code>alpha</code> to <code>ng</code>. I stopped because I hit some trouble which I had to work around, then hit some more trouble which I had to work around, at which point I hit some serious trouble. And it wasn't that <code>ng</code> had bugs or did things wrong either, it was that Druid used aspects of <code>alpha</code> (mainly in the grammar engine) that simply didn't exist anymore. I now think that Druid needs a mid-sized redesign; the old design worked under <code>alpha</code>, but for <code>ng</code> Druid needs something new.</p>

<p>It's not just the <code>alpha</code>-to-<code>ng</code> transition. Last night while going by car to visit Amsterdam.pm, I picked up a two months old slides-generating script, thinking I might use it to whip up a presentation for the evening. Turned out it had a <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=78234">regression bug</a> and <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=78232">another regression bug</a>. This is exactly the effect the Jargon File describes as <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/b/bitrot.html">bit rot</a>:</p>

<div class="quote">Hypothetical disease the existence of which has been deduced from the observation that unused programs or features will often stop working after sufficient time has passed, even if `nothing has changed'. The theory explains that bits decay as if they were radioactive. As time passes, the contents of a file or the code in a program will become increasingly garbled.</div>

<p>Instead of trying to work around the bugs in the car, I stashed two bug reports and eventually made a talk around the script instead. (And I didn't have to run it.)</p>

<p>Bitrot happens quickly in Rakudo applications. This basically tells me three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have more Perl 6 code than I'm currently able to maintain.</li>
<li>As much as I like tests and try to write tests, I have too few of them.</li>
<li>For some time, I've been dreaming of a nightly tester. It's really getting to be time to write it. With a bit of luck, it would help discover and alleviate bitrot.</li>
</ul>

<p>It could perhaps be seen as a tad ironic that in wanting to help create a tool chain for Perl 6, I have instead fallen victim to the lack of it. Oh well; live and learn.</p>
