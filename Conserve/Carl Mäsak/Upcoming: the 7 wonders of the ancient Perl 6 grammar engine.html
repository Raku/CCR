  </header>

  <p>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_Grammar_Engine">PGE</a> is successively being replaced and superceded by pmichaud++'s <a href="http://github.com/perl6/nqp-rx">nqp-rx</a>, I find myself stuck in the past, wanting to investigate how regex-based parsing has been done all this time in Rakudo. I became so hung up on it that I started <a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/">writing my own Perl 6 port</a> of it, and <a href="http://masak.org/carl/bpw-2009-gge/talk.pdf">gave a presentation</a> about it at Baltic Perl Workshop.</p>

<p>But somehow, that wasn't enough. I want more. I plan to <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/code-reviews-a-manifesto">write a code review</a> of PGE, somewhere around Christmas 2009. But before that, I'd like to blog about the things I've learned looking at the PGE code: about parsing, about parsers, and about regular expressions.</p>

<p>That's why, as soon as <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/here-we-go-again-another-full-month-of-november">this November thing</a> comes to a conclusion, I'll be blogging about "the 7 wonders of the ancient Perl 6 grammar engine". The intended target group is people who feel they could use a comprehensive walk through the internals of a regex parser, thus getting a firmer grip on regular expressions. I figure if I unload all such info in a series of posts, the review itself can focus more on the literary aspects of the PGE source code. Also, the series, about two posts a week, will coincide with my finishing up GGE, the PGE port.</p>

<p>You might ask yourself what the 7 wonders might be. I don't know yet, but I have some ideas already. Those who watched my presentation know I like quantifiers, and readers of this blog know <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/what-you-can-do-with-ggeoptable-that-you-couldnt-without">I have a soft spot for <code>OPTable</code> </a>. But we'll see; no need for premature solidification.</p>
