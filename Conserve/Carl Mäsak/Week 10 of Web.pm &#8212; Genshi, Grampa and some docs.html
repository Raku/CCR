<p>Today I've had some fairly good progress with Hitomi, the XML templater. Using the draft grammar moritz++ helped me build, I created a class that takes an XML document and translates it to a stream of events. This makes about half of the tests that I ported from Genshi <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/week-9-of-webpm-encodings-and-a-deep-dive-into-genshi">last time</a> pass; the other half of that test file concern tag soup input — I think I'll punt that one for now, and go for the lower hanging fruit: the classes <code>Template</code> and <code>MarkupTemplate</code>. With those, it should be possible to actually, you know, do some templating.</p>

<p>I'm getting more and more familiar with the original Python code, and starting to have some significant respect for the Genshi code base. It's simply a very well-thought-out piece of software. I can see why people like it. The project doesn't seem terribly active, unfortunately, so sometimes questions from me and others go unanswered on the <code>#python-genshi</code> IRC channel.</p>

<p>Is Hitomi a good name? jnthn++ pointed out today that it sounded very similar to "hit on me", and I find myself constantly writing either "Hitmo" or "Himoti". Then again, I kinda like that it means (or so I've read) "doubly beautiful", and I don't have a better suggestion at the moment.</p>

<p>Another thing that has been going on in the past week is that viklund++ said, almost in passing, that it'd be nice to have an XPath engine for <code>Match</code> objects. I thought it was a great idea, and incubated the project <a href="http://github.com/masak/grampa">"Grampa"</a> (short for "grammar paths") on github. I've since made some good progress on it, and it's already slightly useful. Not to mention that I've learned a few new things about XPath and EBNF that I didn't know before. pmichaud++ helped me with some questions on the latter.</p>

<p>How does that tie into Web.pm? Well, it turns out that at least two of the subprojects of Web.pm would benefit from XPath searches: Hitomi, and Happle (our Hpricot clone). This suggests that Grampa should really be a <code>Match</code> front-end to an XPath query back-end, so that the back-end can then be reused in other projects. I've been implementing Grampa with this in mind.</p>

<p>Finally, since it's nearing the end of my original part of the grant, I've taken a fresh look at <a href="http://github.com/masak/web/blob/master/doc/PLAN">doc/PLAN</a> and refined it a little. No major course corrections were needed, which feels comforting. I'll probably write some more about the status of the subprojects in next week's blog post.</p>

<p>Another thing I plan to do in the coming week is start on my Web.pm talk for YAPC::EU. I thought I'd write the talk in Perl 6 Pod, and then do various conversions to end up with a PDF. Since most of the toolchain for doing that doesn't exist yet, I thought I'd better start now. 哈哈</p>

<p>I wish to thank The Perl Foundation for sponsoring the Web.pm effort.</p>
