<p>Two things of note have happened this week.</p>

<p>First, lively discussion on dispatching continued. It took place mostly on <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/november-wiki/">#november-wiki</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/november-wiki">november-wiki@googlegroups.com</a>. (We've decided to use these as our platform for Web.pm discussion. Anyone interested is encouraged to join in.) ihrd, moritz and ruoso contributed most of the discussion.</p>

<p>There are a lot of possible ways to do dispatch. We want a good, reasonable default way in Web.pm. What eventually emerged was the idea of building the URL dispatch on top of the <a href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S12.html#Multisubs_and_Multimethods">MMD (multi-method dispatch)</a> already built into Perl 6. After that, the discussion focused mainly on exactly how to do this. I look forward to seeing a working example of this really soon.</p>

<p>Second, I started porting Rack. In doing this, I realised, on a slightly deeper level than I had before, that Rack embodies many things that Web.pm wants to be. Peruse <a href="http://chneukirchen.org/talks/#introducingrack">this presentation</a> by chneukirchen, and you might start to see what I mean.</p>

<p>The obvious first targets to port are Rack::Request and Rack::Response, both of which depended on Rack::Utils, so I started with that. <a href="http://github.com/masak/web/blob/8bf8c15674b675497a87091df27fa621a2979806/lib/Web/Utils.pm">Porting Ruby code</a> was exhilirating. Not only that, there's a feel about Rack that it's very stable, thoroughly used and tested code. None of the short-term hacks November is currently built on.</p>

<p>I also broke our decision to target the latest Rakudo developer release, by writing code that used <code>unpack($str, 'H2')</code> and its inverse. Since I don't want to be the one to introduce broken code into the repository, I've decided to spend parts of tomorrow patching Rakudo's <code>unpack</code> to handle this case. The next developer release of Rakudo ('Rakudo Oslo') is on Thursday.</p>

<p>All in all, it feels like I'm on track. I've been increasingly asking myself "What will November need to start using Web.pm in a few weeks?". The answer to that question — which seems to be "requests and responses, templating, sessions" — is what I'll be concentrating my efforts on in the next few weeks. I can already tell that cleaning up those parts of November and moving them over to Web.pm is something I will enjoy very much.</p>

<p>I wish to thank The Perl Foundation for sponsoring the Web.pm effort.</p>
