  <p>Remember that long-term solution for conversions between strings and arrays of bytes that I mentioned <a href="http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/week-2-of-gsoc-work-on-buf-the-power-of-swedish-beer">last week</a> that the Parrot people were discussing?</p>

<p>No? Well, anyway, NotFound++ wrote one, and he suggested I try it for my Str⇄Buf conversions. It worked!</p>

<p>I thought I would get more than that done this week, but I didn't. Oh well. For next week, there are still a few low-hanging branches of fruit to persue.</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to add <code>postfix:&lt;[ ]&gt;</code> indexing to the Buf class, so it feels a bit more Positional.</li>
<li>There's a lot of bounds-checking that needs to be made, both in the constructor and in decoding.</li>
<li>I have UTF-8 down pat; need to find a way to convince Parrot to do other encodings, such as ISO-8859-1.</li>
<li>There's one test that talks about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sadahiro/Unicode-Normalize-1.06-withoutworldwriteables/Normalize.pm">NFD</a>. Haven't even started looking at that yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's interesting to see where all the effort goes. I've spent most of my time so far on the <code>Str.encode</code> and <code>Buf.decode</code> methods, and almost everything else is trivial in comparison. Feels like some sort of 90%-10% rule at work.</p>
