  </header>

  <p>It is with undue sprightliness that I want to announce, on behalf of the Yapsidevelopment team, the May 2010 release of Yapsi, a Perl 6 compiler written in Perl 6.</p>

<p>You can get it <a href="http://github.com/downloads/masak/yapsi/yapsi-2010.05.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>

<p>Yapsi is implemented in Perl 6. It thus requires a Perl 6 implementation to build and run. We recommend the 'alpha' branch of Rakudo for this purpose.</p>

<p>Yapsi is an 'official and complete' Perl 6 release. It's official because we have little labels with the word 'official' on them that we glue to each download that takes off from github. (That much gluing takes a lot of work, but we think of it as a community service.) It's complete in the sense that all of the things it implements, it does. With gusto.</p>

<p>Instructions for getting Yapsi up and running:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have a built Rakudo alpha in your $PATH as 'alpha'.</li>
<li>Download Yapsi from <a href="http://github.com/masak/yapsi/downloads">here</a>.</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>

<p>The third (optional) step consists of running 'make' in the Yapsi directory. This will precompile Yapsi, making startup times much more bearable.</p>

<p>The big change since last month is that Yapsi now does immediate blocks.</p>

<pre><code>$ export PERL6LIB=`pwd`/lib

$ ./yapsi -e 'my $a = 42; { my $a = 7; say $a }; say $a'
7
42
</code></pre>

<p>For other changes, see the doc/ChangeLog file.</p>

<p>This release, as opposed to the last one, contains hidden bugs. We encourage you to help us find them; if not for the fame and glory, than at least for the Schadenfreude.</p>

<p>Yapsi consists of a compiler and a runtime. The program is compiled down into an instruction code, which can be stored and executed weeks, years or even days [<em>sic</em>] later. If you want, you can execute the same piece of SIC several times over. All SIC listings start with a versioning line saying e.g. "This is SIC v2010.05". At this point during Yapsi development, we provide no guarantees about backwards compatibility whatsoever. Expect breakage between monthly releases.</p>

<p>An overarching goal for making a Perl 6 compiler-and-runtime is to use it as a server for various other projects, which will hook in at different steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>A time-traveling debugger (tardis), which will hook into the runtime.</li>
<li>A coverage tool (lid), which will also hook into the runtime.</li>
<li>A syntax checker (sigmund), which will use output from the parser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another overarching goal is to optimize for fun while learning about parsers, compilers, and runtimes. We wish you the appropriate amount of fun!</p>
