  </header>

  <p>It is with a boisterous belly laugh that I announce on behalf of the Yapsi
development team that the December 2010 release of Yapsi, a Perl 6 compiler
made of Perl 6, by Perl 6, for Perl 6, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

<p>You can download it <a href="http://github.com/downloads/masak/yapsi/yapsi-2010.12.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>

<p>Yapsi is implemented in Perl 6. It thus requires a Perl 6 implementation to
build and run. This release of Yapsi has been confirmed to work on all
releases of Rakudo Star to date.</p>

<p>Yapsi is an "official and complete" implementation of Perl 6. Usually in
the rest of this paragraph I perform some obscure hand-waving or
ill-formed logic to pretend that the terms "official" and "complete"
apply to Yapsi... but today I'd like to break from that norm and simply
proceed by structural meta-circular induction on this paragraph, which
in itself happens to be official and complete. QED.</p>

<p>This month's release sets the stage for subroutines (and takes a bold step
towards Turing-completeness) by allowing programs that put blocks of code
into variables:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/yapsi -e 'my $a; my $b = { say $a }; $a = 42; $b()'
42
</code></pre>

<p>For a complete list of changes, see <a href="http://github.com/masak/yapsi/blob/master/doc/ChangeLog"><code>doc/ChangeLog</code></a>.</p>

<p>Quite a lot of features are within reach of people who are interested in
hacking on Yapsi. See the <a href="http://github.com/masak/yapsi/blob/master/doc/LOLHALP"><code>doc/LOLHALP</code></a> file for a list of 'em. Or see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_containing_Q_not_followed_by_U">here</a>
for a list of English words containing the letter Q not followed by the
letter U.</p>

<p>Yapsi consists of a compiler and a runtime. The compiler generates instruction
code which the runtime then interprets. Cool, huh? Actually, that's quite
standard. What's not standard is calling the instruction format SIC, and then
not really having a good idea what it stands for. But never mind; you can
either produce SIC code or plug it right into the runtime -- of which, by
the way, famous Perl 6 implementor Jonathan Worthington after learning
about its inner workings is known to have said "Wow! I don't think I could
design something that slow even if I tried!" Though not very fast at all, the
runtime is very easy to modify, which has the effect that we modify it quite
a lot. We also modify SIC quite a bit; if you expect it not to change,
expect that expectation to come back and bite you.</p>

<p>An overarching goal for making a Perl 6 compiler-and-runtime is to use it as
a server for various other projects, which hook in at different steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>A time-traveling debugger (tardis), which hooks into the runtime.
Already underway, see <a href="http://github.com/masak/tardis">Github</a>.</li>
<li>A coverage tool (lid), which will also hook into the runtime.</li>
<li>A syntax checker (sigmund), which will use output from the parser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another overarching goal is to optimize for fun while learning about parsers,
compilers, and runtimes. \o/</p>

<p>Have the appropriate amount of fun!</p>
