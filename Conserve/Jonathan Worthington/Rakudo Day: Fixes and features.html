<div class="span8">
<p><p>So, here we are with the last Rakudo day before Christmas break. After a rather feature-filled last Rakudo day, I figured this week was time to take on some of the bugs in the RT queue.</p>

<p>masak found a bug in multiple dispatch, where it reported an ambiguity instead of no applicable candidates in cases where you had a bunch tied on constraints where none of the constraints matched. So, I fixed it. By the way, he was doing something pretty cool when he found the bug:</p>
<code>multi foo(&c where { .arity == 1 }) { say "One." };<br>
multi foo(&c where { .arity == 2 }) { say "Two." };<br></code>
<p>That is, multi-dispatching on the arity of the passed code block. (This worked, it was just when foo({{$^a + $^b + $^c }) was called, with arity 3, it gave the wrong kind of error.) You can do some wonderful things in Perl 6. :-)</p>

<p>Another quirk found through playing around with this was that if you wrote a sub taking a paramter with the sigil &, we needed to check that it was something that you could invoke. In Perl 6, that's the Callable role. So I stubbed that in, got Code to do it, and added a small temporary workaround to make typechecking work out on it since we aren't re-blessing Parrot subs into Perl 6 types just yet. And now if you were to call foo(42), continuing the example above, you'll get a type-check failure. Happily, multi-dispatch based on the sigil type just worked from this chance without any additional tweaks, which is what I expected.</p>
<code>multi bar($x) { 1 }<br>
multi bar(&x) { 2 }<br>
say bar(42) # 1<br>
say bar({42}) # 2<br></code>

<p>Next up, I worked on adding a missing feature that had been requested: the .clone method. This in its most basic form, which I added first, lets you clone an object. The clone has its own state distinct from that of the original.</p>
<code>class A { has $.x is rw };<br>
my $a = A.new(x => 5);<br>
my $a2 = $a.clone;<br>
$a2.x = 42;<br>
say $a.x; # 5 - original unaffected<br>
say $a2.x; # 42<br></code>
<p>You can also change the values of attributes, such as in the S12 example:</p>
<code>$newdog = $olddog.clone(:trick<RollOver>);<br></code>
<p>Which just goes to show that while you can't teach an old dog new tricks, you can always get him cloned and teach his clone a new one. Anyway, added various new tests for the clone stuff, as well as unfudging those already there.</p>

<p>Smart-matching against arrays and lists had been requested, so I set about getting us an implementation of that. It supports * wildcard too, which can stand for any element. So you can now do things like:</p>
<code>say (1,2,3) ~~ (1,2,3); # 1<br>
say (1,2,3) ~~ (1,2,3,4); # 0<br>
say (1,2,3) ~~ (*,2,*); # 1 (like, does it contain a 2)<br>
say (1,2,3) ~~ (1,*); # 1 (does it start with a 1)<br>
say (1,2,3) ~~ (*,3); # 1 (does it end with a 3)<br></code>

<p>Some other fixes in brief.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed doing private method calls with an indirect name, e.g. $obj!'foo'().</li>
  <li>Applied a patch and added a test from Ronald Schmidt to handle substr being invoked with a negative start and length (the patch should now give us the Perl 5 behaviour on this).</li>
  <li>Applied a patch from Chris Dolan to fix some grammar and nested namespace issues, and added the example from his ticket as a spectest.</li>
  <li>Reviewed, commented on and in a couple of cases where the issue was dealt with closed various other tickets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Vienna.pm for funding this Rakudo Day!</p></p>

<h2>Wow!</h2>

<p>I step away from tracking Rakudo for a month or two and BAM!  It's incredible how much has been added.</p><p>I have wanted to reimplement<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.trans as an alternating grammar but I've been waiting for LTM (and have been hellaciously busy getting a bioperl release out).  Can't wait to jump back and start on bioperl6!</p>
