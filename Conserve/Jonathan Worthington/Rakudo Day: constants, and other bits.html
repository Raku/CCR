<p>If your Rakudo is built with ICU, you can use unicode characters for the name too. :-) Also, you can use a name with a sigil:</p>

<code>constant $pi = 3.14;<br>
say $pi; # 3.14<br>
$pi = 42; # error<br></code>

<p>And even use the constant as a type constraint...</p>

<code>constant answer = 42;<br>
my answer $x = 42; # ok<br>
$x = 43; # dies<br></code>

<p>masak asked if we could possibly report the provided and expect types when reporting type-check failures, to give better feedback. I implemented this, and also managed to simplify and fix another bug inside the signature binder along the way, which had meant the following would not work:</p>

<code>sub foo(@a) { say @a.elems }<br>
foo([1,2]|[3,4,5]);<br></code>

<p>This will now auto-thread and call foo twice, the first time outputting 2 and the second time 3.</p>

<p>I also fixed a couple of other little bugs in Rakudo.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You could not write things like module Foo { if 1 { say 42 } } (basically, anything involving an inner non-routine block placed directly inside a package). This is now fixed.</li>
  <li>Subtypes based upon user-defined classes and roles didn't always work. I fixed this up and added tests.</li>
  <li>We did a poor job of reporting typed arrays and hashes hashes when doing .perl on a Signature (which is what the multi-dispatcher does on ambiguity reports). I did some work to improve the output here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, Tene has been working for a while on getting Rakudo to live in its own HLL namespace in Parrot, which will enable us to clear up a few other things and no doubt resolve a few tickets (it'll stop us colliding with Parrot internal bits for one). There was some debugging work to do, so I spent a couple of hours on this, and got us a lot further than we were. Still much to do, but we'll get there.</p>

<p>Thanks to Vienna.pm for sponsoring this Rakudo Day.</p></p>
