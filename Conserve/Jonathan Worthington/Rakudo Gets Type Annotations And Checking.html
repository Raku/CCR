<div class="span8">
<p><p>I spent the weekend and most of Monday at the Oslo QA Hackathon. While 

I'm not a QA expert, it did provide me with time and a relative lack of 

distractions to get some work done on Rakudo. It was also nice seeing lots 

of Perl folks, some of whom I've not seen in quite a while. The Hackathon 

has had a very productive atmosphere with lots getting done; in this post 

I'll describe some of my Rakudo exploits.</p>

<p>The biggest thing I have been working on is type annotations. This now 

works with both variable declarations and in the signatures of subroutines 

and methods, although writing them in a multi-method doesn't lead to any 

type-based MMD just yet. Attributes of classes can't have types yet either. 

There are some quirks with various built-in types (including Str and Code 

types), though many others work fine (Int, Num, Pair, etc). With your own 

classes, roles and subset types, it should work just fine.</p>

<p>So, for example, if you declare a variable as having type Int, then try 

and assign a string to it, you'll get a type check failure (we'll get a 

nicer error message in the end).</p>

<code>my Int $x = 42; # this is ok<br />
my Int $x = "hello"; # this is not<br />
Type check failed<br /></code>

<p>Here's a class example.</p>

<code>class Foo { }<br />
class Bar is Foo { }<br />
class Baz { }<br />
my Foo $x; $x = Foo.new(); # ok, Foo is a Foo<br />
my Foo $x; $x = Bar.new(); # ok, Bar is a Foo<br />
my Foo $x; $x = Baz.new(); # not OK<br />
Type check failed<br />
my Bar $x; $x = Foo.new(); # not OK; Foo is not a Bar<br />
Type check failed<br /></code>

<p>Refinement types also work with this.</p>

<code>subset EvenInt of Int where { $_ % 2 == 0 };<br />
my EvenInt $x = 4; say $x;<br />
4<br />
my EvenInt $x = 4; say $x; $x = 3; say $x;<br />
4<br />
Type check failed<br /></code>

<p>You can do all of this with parameters too, as well as declaring an anonymous refinement.</p>

<code>sub Test(Int where { 0 &lt; $_ &lt;= 100 } $x) { say $x }<br />
Test(50)<br />
50<br />
Test(0) # fails constraint<br />
Parameter type check failed<br />
Test("50") # not an Int<br />
Parameter type check failed<br /></code>

<p>Of course, if we drop the Int from the above, then we get coercion:</p>

<code>sub Test(where { 0 &lt; $_ &lt;= 100 } $x) { say $x }<br />
Test(50)<br />
50<br />
Test("50") # matches constraint when numified<br />
50<br />
Test(0) # still fails it, as expected<br />
Parameter type check failed<br /></code>

<p>Getting this to work forced me to refactor the type hierarchy somewhat - 

a job that needed doing, but that I'd been putting off (partly out of not 

trusting myself to do it right). It was a tad nasty, and needed some fixes 

inside Parrot too. However, the net result is that the majority of built-in 

object types, such as Int, now inherit from Any (which we didn't have 

before), and that in turn inherits from Object. The Any distinction will be 

needed to get junction auto-threading of arguments to work properly; my 

initial attempt was inefficient and broken. We'll most likely need to do 

HLL type mapping and similar before that will really work too, though. But 

anyway, now the following things give what you'd expect.</p>

<code>if 42 ~~ Any { say "yes" }<br />
yes<br />
if 42 ~~ Object { say "yes" }<br />
yes<br />
if 42 | 43 ~~ Any { say "yes" }<br />
if 42 | 43 ~~ Object { say "yes" }<br />
yes<br />
if 42 | 43 ~~ Junction { say "yes" }<br />
yes</code><br />

<p>I've done a few other things, but I've got a work meeting here tomorrow, 

so I'm going to sleep now and write about them soon.</p></p>

<p>I would just like to say that this is really, really awesome and thank you for putting so much of your free time into this.</p>
