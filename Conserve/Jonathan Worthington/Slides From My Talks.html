<p><p>So, after some time "on the road", mostly spent going to Perl events, I'm finally back home, where I'll be pretty much staying for the next two and a half months. Certainly, I don't plan to fly anywhere before YAPC::EU::2008; no doubt I'll enjoy a couple of weekend breaks that I can take by train first, though. Home is currently Bratislava (capital of Slovakia), so having so many interesting bits of central and east europe so close to hand will be far too much to resist. I plan to make it over to the western Ukraine (I loved Kiev and want to check out Lvov), and hopefully see Poprad and take a bit of hiking in the nice mountains in that area.</p>

<p>I've now got all of my slides uploaded to my <a href="http://www.jnthn.net/articles.shtml">talks page</a>, and here are a few direct links with summaries to help you get to the juicy stuff faster.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2008-vienna-rakudo-slides.pdf">Implementing Perl 6, in Perl 6, on Parrot</a> - I gave this one at the Nordic Perl Workshop, French Perl Workshop and to Vienna.pm. The slides were very nearly the same for all of them, so I just linked to the Vienna.pm version, which was the final one.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2008-fpw-perl6-slides.pdf">Perl 6 Tutorial</a> - from the French Perl Workshop. This was delivered in the space of two hours, and assumes no prior knowledge of Perl 6 (but some basic Perl 5 knowledge). The vast majority of what it covers is usable today in Rakudo.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2008-npw-understanding-perl6-slides.pdf">Understanding Perl 6</a> - this one could also have been called Perl 6 For Computer Scientists (there were variuous people who were doing academic research in computer science at the workshop). It's aimed at explaining how the features of Perl 6 fit together and giving a big picture of the language rather than dealing with syntax and practical usage.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2008-fpw-teaching-slides.pdf">Using Perl 6 And Parrot In Teaching</a> - a look at how Parrot, PCT and Perl 6 could be used in teaching.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2008-us-pct-slides.pdf">All Your Dynamic Languages Are Belong To Us</a> - this was a guest lecture at a university in Stockholm to a bunch of undergraduate students. I introduced both Parrot and PCT, and then built a compiler live on stage. Overall, the talk lasted an hour; the compiler was built in just over 35 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Best Practical and The Perl Foundation for giving me a grant to travel to help fund my travel to these events, to Claes Jakobsson for very kindly letting me stay at his place in Stockholm (and also for cooking some really delicious Swedish meatballs) and to the many people I met along the way who made the last couple of weeks a lot of fun.</p></p>
