  <p>If you've been following Rakudo's development since first language release on
Christmas, 2015, you might've heard of numerous people working to bring CPAN
support to Rakudo Perl 6.</p>

<p>Good news! It's finally here in usable form and you should start using it!</p>

<p>Let's talk about all the moving parts and how to upload your dists
to CPAN.</p>

<h2 id="themovingpartsandstatusreport">The Moving Parts and Status Report</h2>

<p>All of the heavy lifting has been done awhile back, during Perl Toolchain Summit and other times. I wasn't present for it to know the details, but to
catch up you could
join <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6-toolchain">#perl6-toolchain chat</a> and talk to humans or read <a href="https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-toolchain/2017-10-06">the channel log</a>. <abbr
title="Perl [programming] Authors Upload Server">PAUSE</abbr>/CPAN
support for Perl 6 dists was implemented and <a href="https://modules.perl6.org/dist/zef">zef module installer</a> was trained to check for CPAN dists
as well as our GitHub/GitLab-based ecosystem (called "p6c").</p>

<p>The only bit that was left missing is a front-end to browse available CPAN
dists. There is a team who wished to take <a href="https://metacpan.org/">metacpan.org</a>'s codebase and modify it for Rakudo dists. I'm told that project is currently
"stalled but not dead".</p>

<p>That's unfortunate, however, earlier this week,
<a href="https://modules.perl6.org">modules.perl6.org</a> was
<a href="http://modules.perl6.org/search/?q=from%3Acpan">taught to handle CPAN dists</a>,
so—hooray!—we finally have some sort of a front-end for CPAN dists. If you
only want to see CPAN dists in search results, you can use <code>from:cpan</code> search
qualifier (just like you can use <code>from:github</code> and <code>from:gitlab</code> ones).</p>

<p>GitHub/GitLab dists URLs still direct to repos, but CPAN dists have a
<a href="http://modules.perl6.org/dist/Number::Denominate:cpan:ZOFFIX">file browser</a>
that lets you see what files are up in the dist. The file browser also
renders <code>README.md</code>/<code>README.markdown</code> markdown readme files.</p>

<p>The viewer doesn't have all the bells and whistles of
<a href="https://metacpan.org/">metacpan.org</a> and doesn't (yet) render POD6, but it's
certainly useable. The person who implemented this viewer will be busy
preparing 6.d language release in the near future and won't have the time
to make additional improvements to the CPAN dist viewer. So… <a href="https://github.com/perl6/modules.perl6.org">you're invited
to contribute</a> and make it better!</p>

<h2 id="whyuploadtocpan">Why Upload to CPAN</h2>

<p>CPAN has many mirrors ensuring module installation is not affected whenever
GitHub (a single website) has issues. The uploaded dists are also immutable
and stay there forever (barring special deletion requests, even deleted dists
remain available on <a href="http://backpan.perl.org/">BackPAN</a>). This means people
are more likely to trust these dists for use in their larger projects that
need dependable dependencies. Lastly… it's what the cool kids use!</p>

<h2 id="howtouploadtocpan">How to Upload to CPAN</h2>

<p>Here's the process for how you can get your dists to CPAN. If these dists
are currently listed in our p6c ecosystem, both p6c and CPAN versions will
appear on <a href="https://modules.perl6.org">modules.perl6.org</a>, and you're encouraged
to remove the p6c version. Some of the described tools are brand-new and others
are brand-old, created before Rakudo existed, so treat this
guide as part information and part invitation to improve the tools.</p>

<h3 id="step1:getapauseaccount">Step 1: Get a PAUSE account</h3>

<p>PAUSE stands for "The [Perl programming] Authors Upload Server", it's located
at <a href="https://pause.perl.org">pause.perl.org</a>, and it's a
site you use to upload dists to CPAN.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=request_id">request PAUSE account page</a> and subscribe for an account. The
"desired ID" field is for your PAUSE ID, and it's currently used as "author"
field on <a href="https://modules.perl6.org">modules.perl6.org</a>. For example, <a href="https://modules.perl6.org/search/?q=from%3Acpan+author%3AZOFFIX">mine is ZOFFIX</a>.</p>

<p>I had my account for over a decade, so my memory is a bit fuzzy, but I think you'll need to wait for a human to approve and create your account—it's not instantaneous.</p>

<h3 id="step2:makeadistarchive">Step 2: Make a Dist Archive</h3>

<p>You can manually create a tarball or a zip archive. I don't have all the
details on which files you're supposed to have in them; you can
<a href="http://modules.perl6.org/search/?q=from%3Acpan">take a look at other CPAN dists</a> to see what they're doing or…</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://modules.perl6.org/dist/App::Mi6:github">App::Mi6 module</a>! It's
possible you were already using it to create dists, in which case you're in
luck, as you can just run <code>mi6 dist</code> to make a dist archive.</p>

<p>I rolled my dists by hand and wrote all the docs in <code>README.md</code>, so when I
gave <code>mi6 dist</code> a whirl, it
<a href="https://github.com/skaji/mi6/issues/23">replaced my <code>README.md</code></a> with
emptiness because I wasn't using any POD6—something (currently) to watch
out for.</p>

<h3 id="step3:uploadyourdist">Step 3: Upload Your Dist</h3>

<p>The first option is to upload manually: log into
<a href="https://pause.perl.org">pause.perl.org</a>, then go to
<a href="https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=add_uri">Upload a file to CPAN</a>, be sure to select <code>Perl6</code> in the select input and then upload either
via an uploaded file or a URL.</p>

<p>The second option is to use <a href="http://modules.perl6.org/dist/App::Mi6:github">App::Mi6</a>'s <code>mi6 upload</code> command.</p>

<p>Shortly after the upload, you'll get an email about whether your upload
succeeded (you can also see emails on <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.uploads/">nntp.perl.org</a>). Make sure you have a <code>META6.json</code> file
in your dist and that the dist
version you're uploading is higher than the currently uploaded version. Those
are the most common upload errors.</p>

<h3 id="step4:relaxandwait">Step 4: Relax and Wait</h3>

<p>If you're <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6">on IRC</a>,
in about 10 minutes after your upload, our buggable robot will announce it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>&lt;buggable&gt;</b> New CPAN upload: Number-Denominate-1.001001.tar.gz by ZOFFIX<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.cpan.org/authors/id/Z/ZO/ZOFFIX/Perl6/Number-Denominate-1.001001.tar.gz<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In about 2 hours, the dist will also appear on <a href="https://modules.perl6.org">modules.perl6.org</a>. Its updater is started in a cron job on 20th and 40th minute of the hour (unless a job is already running) and it
<a href="https://modules.perl6.org/update.log">takes about 2 hours</a> to finish each run.</p>

<h3 id="step5:celebratewiththeappropriateamountoffun">Step 5: Celebrate with the Appropriate Amount of Fun</h3>

<p>That's about it to the process. I foresee more tools will be created in the
future to make the process even easier than it is today. If you have any
questions or issues, just talk to a human or a robot
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6">on our #perl6 IRC channel</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>CPAN support for Rakudo Perl 6 dists is now usably here. You're encouraged
to upload your dists to CPAN, to grow a more dependable ecosystem. You're
also invited to improve and create tooling that manages and displays CPAN
uploads.</p>
