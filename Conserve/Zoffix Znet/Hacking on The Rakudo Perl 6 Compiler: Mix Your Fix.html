    2016-08-01 <span class="words-count">| 2216 words |</span> An example of fixing a bug in Rakudo</p>
  <p>While testing a fix for one of the Less Than Awesome behaviours in standalone
<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature"><code>Signature</code></a> objects, I came across
a bugglet. Smartmatching two Signatures throws, while spilling a bit of the
guts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;Zoffix&gt; m: my $m = method ($a: $b) { }; say $m.signature ~~ :($a, $b);<br>
  &lt;camelia&gt; rakudo-moar 46838d: OUTPUT«Method 'type' not found
  for invocant of class 'Any'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I figured I'll write about fixing it, 'cause hacking on internals is lots of
fun. Let's roll!</p>

<h2 id="golfitdown">Golf It Down</h2>

<p>The less code there is to reproduces the bug, the fewer places there are
for that bug to hide. We have a detached method and then we smartmatch
its signature against something else. Let's try to golf it down a bit
and smartmatch two Signatures, without involving a method:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;Zoffix&gt; m: :($a, $b) ~~ :($a, $b);<br>
  &lt;camelia&gt; rakudo-moar 46838d: ( no output )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bug disappeared, so perhaps out Signature on the left doesn't contain
the stuff that triggers the bug. Let's dump the signature of the method to see
what we should match against:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;Zoffix&gt; m: my $m = method ($a: $b) { }; say $m.signature
  &lt;camelia&gt; rakudo-moar 46838d: OUTPUT«($a: $b, *%_)␤»</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aha! It has a slurpy hash: <code>*%_</code>. Let's try matching a Signature with a
slurpy in it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;Zoffix&gt; m: <code>:(*%) ~~ :();</code><br>
  &lt;camelia&gt; rakudo-moar 46838d: OUTPUT«Method 'type' not found
  for invocant of class 'Any'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there we go: hole in three. Let's proceed.</p>

<h2 id="roastit">Roast It</h2>

<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/perl6/roast">an official Perl 6 test suite</a> that
Rakudo must pass to be called a Perl 6 compiler. Since we got a bug on our
hands, we should add a test for it to the test suite to ensure it doesn't rear
its ugly head again.</p>

<p>The copy of the repo gets automatically cloned into <code>t/spec</code> when you
run <code>make spectest</code> in <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">Rakudo's checkout</a>.
If you don't have a commit bit, you can just change the remote/branch of that
checkout to your fork:</p>

<pre><code>cd t/spec
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/roast
git checkout your-branch
cd ../..
</code></pre>

<p>It may be tricky to figure out which file to put the test in, if you're new.
You can always ask the good folks on
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl6">irc.freenode.net/#perl6</a>
for advice. In this case, I'll place the test
into <code>S06-signature/outside-subroutine.t</code></p>

<p>While not required, I find it helpful to open a ticket for the bug. This
way I can reference it in my fix in the compiler repo, I can reference
it in the commit to the test repo, and people get a place where to tell me
why I'm being stupid when I am. I opened this bug
as <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128795">RT#128795</a>.</p>

<p>Now, for the code of the test itself.
I'll adjust the <code>plan</code> at the top of the file to
include however many tests I'm writing—in this case one. I'll use the
<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/testing#index-entry-lives-ok-lives-ok%28%24code%2C_%24description%3F%29"><code>lives-ok</code></a> test sub and stick our buggy golfed code
into it. Here's the <code>diff</code> of the changes to the file; note the reference
to the ticket number in the comment before the test:</p>

<pre><code>@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@

</code></pre>

<p>Run the file now to ensure the test fails. Hint: some files have fudging;
explaining it is out of the scope of this article, but if you notice failures
you're not expecting, look it up.</p>

<pre><code>$ make t/spec/S06-signature/outside-subroutine.t

</code></pre>

<p>With the test in place, it's time to look at some source code. Let the bug
hunt begin!</p>

<h2 id="makeitsaucy">Make it Saucy</h2>

<p>Our bug involves a Smartmatch operator, which aliases the left side to the topic
variable <code>$_</code> and calls <code>.ACCEPTS</code> method on the right side with it. Both
of our sides are <code>Signature</code> objects, so let's pop open Rakudo's sauce code
for that class.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">the Rakudo's repo</a>,
directory <code>src/core/</code> contains most of the built in types in separate
files named after those types, so we'll just pop open
<a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/Signature.pm"><code>src/core/Signature.pm</code></a> in the editor and locate the definition of method <code>ACCEPTS</code>.</p>

<p>There are actually four multis for <code>ACCEPTS</code>. Here's the full code. Don't
try to understand all of it, just note its size.</p>

<pre><code>multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: Capture $topic) {
    nqp::p6bool(nqp::p6isbindable(self, nqp::decont($topic)));
}

multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: @topic) {
    self.ACCEPTS(@topic.Capture)
}

multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: %topic) {
    self.ACCEPTS(%topic.Capture)
}

multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: Signature:D $topic) {
    my $sclass = self.params.classify({.named});
    my $tclass = $topic.params.classify({.named});
    my @spos := $sclass{False} // ();
    my @tpos := $tclass{False} // ();

    while @spos {
        my $s;
        my $t;
        last unless @tpos &amp;&amp; ($t = @tpos.shift);
        $s=@spos.shift;
        if $s.slurpy or $s.capture {
            @spos=();
            @tpos=();
            last;
        }
        if $t.slurpy or $t.capture {
            return False unless any(@spos) ~~ {.slurpy or .capture};
            @spos=();
            @tpos=();
            last;
        }
        if not $s.optional {
            return False if $t.optional
        }
        return False unless $t ~~ $s;
    }
    return False if @tpos;
    if @spos {
        return False unless @spos[0].optional or @spos[0].slurpy or @spos[0].capture;
    }

    for flat ($sclass{True} // ()).grep({!.optional and !.slurpy}) -&gt; $this {
        my $other;
        return False unless $other=($tclass{True} // ()).grep(
            {!.optional and $_ ~~ $this });
        return False unless +$other == 1;
    }

    my $here=($sclass{True}:v).SetHash;
    my $hasslurpy=($sclass{True} // ()).grep({.slurpy});
    $here{@$hasslurpy} :delete;
    $hasslurpy .= Bool;
    for flat @($tclass{True} // ()) -&gt; $other {
        my $this;

        if $other.slurpy {
            return False if any($here.keys) ~~ -&gt; Any $_ { !(.type =:= Mu) };
            return $hasslurpy;
        }
        if $this=$here.keys.grep( -&gt; $t { $other ~~ $t }) {
            $here{$this[0]} :delete;
        }
        else {
            return False unless $hasslurpy;
        }
    }
    return False unless self.returns =:= $topic.returns;
    True;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error we get from the bug mentions <code>.type</code> method call and there is one
such method call in the code above (close to the end of it). In this case,
there's quite a bit of code to sort through. It would be nice to be able
to play around
with it, stick a couple of <code>dd</code> or <code>say</code> calls to dump out variables, right?</p>

<p>That approach, however, is somewhat annoying because after each change we
have to recompile the entire Rakudo. On the meatiest box I got, it takes about
60 seconds. Not the end of the world, but there's a way to make things
lightning fast!</p>

<h2 id="mixyourfix">Mix Your Fix</h2>

<p>We need to fix a bug in a method of a class. Another way to think of it is:
we need to <em>replace</em> a broken method with a working one. <code>Signature</code> class
is just like any other class, so if we want to replace one of its methods, we
can just mix in a role!</p>

<p>The broken <code>ACCEPTS</code> will continue to live in the compiler, and we'll pop
open a separate playground file and define a role—let's calls it
<code>FixedSignature</code>—in it.
To get our new-and-improved <code>ACCEPTS</code> method in standalone signature objects,
we'll use the <code>but</code> operator to mix the <code>FixedSignature</code> in.</p>

<p>Here's the role, the mixing in, and the code that triggers the bug. I'll
leave out method bodies for brieviety, but there's they are the same as in the
code above.</p>

<pre><code>role FixedSignature {
    multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: Capture $topic)     { #`(redacted for brevity) }
    multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: @topic)             { #`(redacted for brevity) }
    multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: %topic)             { #`(redacted for brevity) }
    multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: Signature:D $topic) { #`(redacted for brevity) }
}

my $a = :(*%) but FixedSignature;
my $b = :()   but FixedSignature;

say $a ~~ $b;
</code></pre>

<p>There are two more things we need to do for our role to work properly.
First, we're dealing with multis and right now the multis in our role
are creating ambiguities with the multis in the original <code>Signature</code> class.
To avoid that, we'll define a proto:</p>

<pre><code>proto method ACCEPTS (|) { * }
</code></pre>

<p>Since the code is using some NQP, we also need to bring in those features
into our playground file with the role. Just add the appropriate pragma
at the top of the file:</p>

<pre><code>use MONKEY-GUTS;
</code></pre>

<p>With these modifications, our final test file becomes the following:</p>

<pre><code>use MONKEY-GUTS;

role FixedSignature {
    proto method ACCEPTS (|) { * }

    multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: Capture $topic)     { #`(redacted for brevity) }
    multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: @topic)             { #`(redacted for brevity) }
    multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: %topic)             { #`(redacted for brevity) }
    multi method ACCEPTS(Signature:D: Signature:D $topic) { #`(redacted for brevity) }
}

my $a = :(*%) but FixedSignature;
my $b = :()   but FixedSignature;

say $a ~~ $b;
</code></pre>

<p>And with this trick in place, we now have a rapid-fire weapon to hunt
down the bug with—the changes we make compile instantly.</p>

<h2 id="pullthetrigger">Pull The Trigger</h2>

<p>Now, we can debug the code just like any other. I prefer applying liberal
amounts of <code>dd</code> (or <code>say</code>) calls and dumping out the variables to ensure
their contents match expectations.</p>

<p>The <code>.type</code> method call our error message mentions is in this line:</p>

<pre><code>return False if any($here.keys) ~~ -&gt; Any $_ { !(.type =:= Mu) };
</code></pre>

<p>It calls it on the keys of <code>$here</code>, so let's dump the <code>$here</code> before that
statement:</p>

<pre><code>...
dd $here
return False if any($here.keys) ~~ -&gt; Any $_ { !(.type =:= Mu) };
...
# OUTPUT:
# SetHash $here = SetHash.new(Any)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's our offending <code>Any</code>, let's go up a bit and dump the <code>$here</code> right where
it's defined:</p>

<pre><code>...
my $here=$sclass{True}.SetHash;
dd $here;
...
# OUTPUT:
# SetHash $here = SetHash.new(Any)
</code></pre>

<p>It's still there, and for a good reason. If we trace the creation of
<code>$sclass</code>, we'll see it's this:</p>

<pre><code>my $sclass = self.params.classify({.named});
</code></pre>

<p>The params of the Signature on the right of the smartmatch get classified
based on whether they are named or not. The named parameters will be inside
a list under the <code>True</code> key of <code>$sclass</code>. Since we do <em>not</em> have any named
params, there won't be such a key, and we can verify that with this bit of
code:</p>

<pre><code>:().params.classify(*.named).say
# OUTPUT:
# {}
</code></pre>

<p>When we go to define <code>$here</code>, we get an <code>Any</code> from <code>$sclass{True}</code>, since
that key doesn't exist, and when we call <code>.SetHash</code> on it, we get our
problematic <code>Sethash</code> object with an <code>Any</code> in it. And so, we have our fix for the bug: ensure the <code>True</code> key in <code>$sclass</code> is actually there before creating
a <code>SetHash</code> out of its value:</p>

<pre><code>my $here=($sclass{True}:v).SetHash;
</code></pre>

<p>Add that to our playground file with the <code>FixedSignature</code> role in it, run it,
and verify the fix works. Now, simply transplant the fix back into
<a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/Signature.pm"><code>src/core/Signature.pm</code></a> and then compile the
compiler.</p>

<pre><code>perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --gen-nqp --backends=moar
make
make test
make install
</code></pre>

<p>Verify our fix worked before we proceed onto the final stages:</p>

<pre><code>$ make t/spec/S06-signature/outside-subroutine.t
...
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=4,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.03 usr  0.00 sys +  0.32 cusr  0.02 csys =  0.37 CPU)
Result: PASS
</code></pre>

<h2 id="acleankill">A Clean Kill</h2>

<p>So far, all we know is the bug we found was fixed and the tests we wrote for
it pass. However, before we ship our fix, we must ensure we didn't break
anything else. There are other devs working from the same repo and you'll be
interfering with their work if you break stuff.</p>

<p>Run the full Roast test suite with <code>make spectest</code> command.
You can use the <code>TEST_JOBS</code> environmental variable to specify the number of
simultaneous tests. Generally a value slightly higher than the available cores
works the fastest... and cores make all the difference. On my 24-core VM I
cut releases on, the spectest completes in about 1 minute and 15 seconds. On
my 2-core web server, it takes about 25 minutes. You get the idea.</p>

<pre><code>TEST_JOBS=28 make spectest
...
All tests successful.
Files=1111, Tests=52510, 82 wallclock secs (13.09 usr 2.44 sys + 1517.34 cusr 97.67 csys = 1630.54 CPU)
Result: PASS
</code></pre>

<p>Once the spectest completes and we have the clean bill of health, we're ready
to ship our fix. Commit the Rakudo fix, then go into <code>t/spec</code> and commit
the Roast fix:</p>

<pre><code>git commit -m 'Fix Smartmatch with two signatures, only one of which has slurpy hash' \
           -m 'Fixes RT#128795' src/core/Signature.pm
git push

cd t/spec
git commit -m 'smartmatch on signature with no slurpy on right side does not crash' \
           -m 'RT#128795' S06-signature/outside-subroutine.t
git push
</code></pre>

<p>If you're pushing to your fork of these projects, you have to go the extra
step and submit a Pull Request (just go to your fork and GitHub should
display a button just for that).</p>

<p>And we're done! Celebrate with the appropriate amount of fun.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Rakudo bugs can be easy to fix, requiring not much more than knowledge of
Perl 6. To fix them, you don't need to re-compile the entire compiler, but
can instead define a small role with a method you're trying to fix and modify
and recompile just that.</p>

<p>It's important to add tests for the bug into the official test suite and
it's also important to run the full spectest after you fix the bug. But
most important of all, is to have fun fixing it.</p>
