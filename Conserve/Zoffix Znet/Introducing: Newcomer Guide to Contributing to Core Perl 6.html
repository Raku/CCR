    2018-08-02 <span class="words-count">| 444 words |</span> Info on the new guide for newcomers</p>
  <p>An important part of a project is to keep a steady flow of new volunteers coming on board to help you out (that's <em>Hug 1: Gift a Shovel</em> in the <a href="/post/On-Troll-Hugging-Hole-Digging-and-Improving-Open-Source-Communities">Hole Digging Metaphor</a>). Starting out can be difficult: you barely know the people who you're working with and you're not familiar with the codebase or the build toolchain. A bug that will take a regular coredeveloper a minute to fix, test, and ship, might be insurmountable for someone who doesn't know where to start.</p>

<p>Perl&nbsp;6 can especially benefit from newcomer help, as core development is
very easy to get into: a lot of bugs involve pure Perl&nbsp;6 code, mixed with some
NQP subroutine calls that aren't much different than using subroutines from
an ecosystem module.</p>

<p>For some time now, the Perl&nbsp;6 devs labeled easy Issues with particular labels.
However, that still leaves some challenges for new volunteers in place: knowing what the labels really mean, knowing how to build the project with the
fix applied, and knowing how to run the tests.</p>

<h2 id="thenewcomerguide">The Newcomer Guide</h2>

<p>To address those issues, I drafted a <a href="/post/Newcomer-Guide-to-Contributing-to-Core-Perl-6">Newcomer Guide to Contributing to Core Perl&nbsp;6</a> that will be
linked to on specially labeled Issues. It's still an early version and will
likely see several revisions based on the type of questions new volunteers ask.</p>

<p>It's meant to be a quick guide a programmer can read to get into contributing
to Rakudo Perl&nbsp;6. It's not meant to be exhaustive, so for example things
like how to submit a Pull Request or make a commit with <code>git</code> are outside of
its scope.</p>

<p>The Z-Script the guide uses haven't seen much battle testing by people without
a commit bit to all the repos, so I suspect that will need some improvement
as well, as people start to use it.</p>

<h2 id="tothecoredevs">To The Core Devs</h2>

<p>Be sure to label easy issues with the labels mentioned in the guide. Encourage people to fix bugs. The person reporting the bug can be given a few tips on
how to fix the very problem they're reporting and asked whether they wish to
submit a fix. You never know when a one-off contributor will become a regular core developer.</p>

<p>The Guide promises the core devs will answer questions and help walk the interested volunteers through the fixes of specially labeled Issues, so keep
an eye open for such questions and help people out. Also, when filing the
Issues for newcomers, add a few tips and suggestions on how the Issue can likely be fixed.</p>

<h2 id="thatsit">That's It</h2>

<p>There isn't much else to say, other than <a href="/post/Newcomer-Guide-to-Contributing-to-Core-Perl-6">check out the Guide itself</a> and help make Perl&nbsp;6 better! :)</p>
