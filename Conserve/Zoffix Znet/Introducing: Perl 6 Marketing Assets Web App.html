    2018-08-05 <span class="words-count">| 558 words |</span> Get your Perl 6 flyers and brochures</p>
  <p>As some of you already may have known from occasional tweets and mentions
in the <a href="https://p6weekly.wordpress.com">Weekly</a>, we have a
<a href="https://github.com/perl6/marketing"><code>perl6/marketing</code> repo</a> that contains
some flyers and brochures for Perl&nbsp;6.</p>

<p>With one of the Perl&nbsp;6 coredevs making a living as a Multi-Media Designer, the
repo has seen a steady stream of new pieces designed, when inspiration strikes,
or when someone makes a request. There are now several pieces available,
but GitHub isn't the greatest interface for this sort of stuff.</p>

<h1 id="introducingmarketing.perl6.org">Introducing marketing.perl6.org</h1>

<p>To make it easier to see what we have available, we made a front-end for our
marketing repo, that lets you browse all of the assets. It's hosted at <a href="https://marketing.perl6.org">marketing.perl6.org</a></p>

<p><a href="https://marketing.perl6.org"><img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive center-block"
    src="/assets/pics/marketingperl6org.png" alt=""></a></p>

<h1 id="theassets">The Assets</h1>

<p>Under the thumbnail of each asset, there are a few buttons that show you
which formats are available for download. The last two buttons are the GitHub
button and the pencil button. The former will lead
you to GitHub to the folder that particular asset is at, where you can download
any files that aren't shown on the front end (e.g. the source files). The latter
will lead you to the New Issue page on the marketing repo, with title/ID
of the piece pre-filled. This is in case you'd like to request different format,
size, or some other changes for that piece.</p>

<p>Each piece has an ID number (a Unix timestamp, e.g <code>1516098660</code>).
If you want to refer to some piece, try to include its ID, as that's the easiest
way for the designer to know what piece you're talking about.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=inb4">INB4</a>, the Camelia logo
variants are so numerous because <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perl6/mu/master/misc/camelia.txt">the rules </a> allow for her colours to be changed. Personally, I prefer transparent wings, as they're
easier on my retinas than the default logo.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, you can request new pieces as well. Just <a href="https://github.com/perl6/marketing/issues/new">file a new Issue in
the marketing repo</a>, describing the content that you want, including the sizes/colour restrictions, and our volunteers will hook you up.</p>

<h1 id="theprints">The Prints</h1>

<p>While files themselves are easy to make for free, the same isn't the case for
hard copies. We (the volunteers handling the marketing repo) can't print
any hardcopies for you. Unless you are able to use a local printing company
and pay out of your own pocket, your best bet would be to contact
<a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> and ask them if they
can sponsor the prints. I know they made prints of the
<a href="https://marketing.perl6.org/id/1516098660/pdf_digital"><em>Introducing Perl&nbsp;6</em> brochure</a> for a
conference in the past.</p>

of the pieces use purchased stock, which may have licenses that limit super-large print runs (50,000+ copies). Check the files in the repo or
<a href="https://twitter.com/zoffix">contact Zoffix</a> if you have an unusual usecase for
the materials and wish to clarify the licensing.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Going out for some tech meetup? Print out a few pieces from our <a href="https://marketing.perl6.org">marketing web app</a>, hand them out, share the Perl&nbsp;6 love!</p>
