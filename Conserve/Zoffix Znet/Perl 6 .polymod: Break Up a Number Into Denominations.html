    2016-05-18 <span class="words-count">| 1380 words |</span> Everything about .polymod method.</p>
  <p>Back in the day, I wrote Perl 5 module
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Number::Denominal">Number::Denominal</a> that breaks up a number into "units," say, 3661 becomes '1 hour, 1 minute, and 1 second'. I felt it was the pinnacle of achievement and awesome to boot.
Later, I ported that module to Perl 6, and recently I found out that Perl 6
actually has <a href="http://docs.perl6.org/routine/polymod"><code>.polymod</code> method</a> built in, which makes half of my cool module entirely useless.</p>

<p>Today, we'll examine what <code>.polymod</code> does and how to use it. And then I'll
talk a bit about my reinvented wheel as well.</p>

<h2 id="denominated">Denominated</h2>

<p>The <code>.polymod</code> method takes a number of divisors and breaks up its invocant
into pieces:</p>

<pre><code>my $seconds = 1 * 60*60*24 # days
            + 3 * 60*60    # hours
            + 4 * 60       # minutes
            + 5;           # seconds

say $seconds.polymod: 60, 60;
say $seconds.polymod: 60, 60, 24;

# OUTPUT:
# (5 4 27)
# (5 4 3 1)
</code></pre>

<p>The divisors we pass as arguments in this case are time related:
60 (seconds per minute), 60 (minutes per hour), and 24 (hours in a day).
From the smallest unit, we're progressing to the largest
one, with the numbers being how many of the unit in question fit into the next
larger unit.</p>

<p>Matching up the output to the expression we assigned to <code>$seconds</code> we can
see that output also progresses‚Äîsame as input divisors‚Äîfrom smallest unit to
largest: 5 seconds, 4 minutes, 3 hours, and 1 day.</p>

<p>Notice how in the first call, we
did not specify a divisor for hours-in-a-day, and so we got our days expressed
as hours (24 hours for one day, plus the 3 hours we had originally). So this
form of <code>.polymod</code> simply uses up all the divisors and the number of returned
items is one more than the number of given divisors.</p>

<h2 id="handmade">Handmade</h2>

<p>Another code example useful to understanding of <code>.polymod</code> is one showing
the previous calculation done with a loop instead, without involving
<code>.polymod</code>:</p>

<pre><code>my $seconds = 2 * 60*60*24 # days
            + 3 * 60*60    # hours
            + 4 * 60       # minutes
            + 5;           # seconds

my @pieces;
for 60, 60, 24 -&gt; $divisor {
    @pieces.push: $seconds mod $divisor;
    $seconds div= $divisor
}
@pieces.push: $seconds;

say @pieces;

# OUTPUT:
# [5 4 3 2]
</code></pre>

<p>For each of the divisors, we take the remainder of integer
division of <code>$seconds</code>
and the divisor being processed and then change the <code>$seconds</code> to the integer
divison between <code>$seconds</code> and that divisor.</p>

<h2 id="toinfinityandbeyond">To Infinity and Beyond!</h2>

<p>Perl 6 is advanced enough to have infinite things in it without blowing up and
that's accomplished with lazy lists. When the divisors given to
<code>.polymod</code> method are in a lazy list, it'll run until the remainder is zero and
not through the whole list:</p>

<pre><code>say 120.polymod:      10¬π, 10¬≤, 10¬≥, 10‚Å¥, 10‚Åµ;
say 120.polymod: lazy 10¬π, 10¬≤, 10¬≥, 10‚Å¥, 10‚Åµ;
say 120.polymod:      10¬π, 10¬≤, 10¬≥ ‚Ä¶ ‚àû;

# OUTPUT:
# (0 12 0 0 0 0)
# (0 12)
# (0 12)
</code></pre>

<p>In the first call, we have a series of numbers increasing by a power of 10.
The output of that call includes 4 trailing zeros, because <code>.polymod</code> evaluated
each divisor. In the second call, we explicitly create a lazy list using
<code>lazy</code> keyword and now we have just two items in the returned list.</p>

<p>The first divisor (<code>10</code>) results in zero remainder, which is our first item in the returned list, and integer division changes our 120 to just 12 for the next divisor. The remainder of division of 12 by 100 is 12, which is our second item in the returned list. Now, integer division of 12 by 100 is zero,
which stops the execution of <code>.polymod</code> and gives us our two-item result.</p>

<p>In the last call, we use an ellipsis, which is
<a href="http://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_...">the sequence operator</a>, to
create the same series of numbers increasing by a power of 10, except this
time that series is infinite. Since it's lazy, the result is, once again,
just two elements.</p>

<h2 id="zipitlockitputitinthepocket">Zip It, Lock It, Put It In The Pocket</h2>

<p>Numbers alone are great and all, but aren't too descriptive about the units
they represent. Let's use
<a href="http://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Zip_Operators">a Zip meta operator</a>,
to fix that issue:</p>

<pre><code>my @units  = &lt;ng Œºg mg g kg&gt;;
my @pieces = 42_666_555_444_333.polymod: 10¬≥ xx ‚àû;

say @pieces Z~ @units;
# OUTPUT:
# (333ng 444Œºg 555mg 666g 42kg)
</code></pre>

<p>For the purposes of our calculation, I'll be breaking up
forty two trillion, six hundred sixty six billion, five hundred fifty five million, four hundred forty four thousand, three hundred and thirty three (üò∏)
nanograms into several larger units.</p>

<p>We store unit names in the array <code>@units</code>. Then, we call <code>.polymod</code> on our
huge number and give it an infinite list with number 1000 for each divisor
and store what it gives us in <code>@pieces</code>.</p>

<p>The Zip meta operator one-by-one takes elements from lists on the left and
right hand sides and applies to them the operator given to it. In this case, we're using the string concatenation operator (<code>~</code>), and
thus our final result is a list of strings with numbers and units.</p>

<h2 id="thatdenominatedquickly">That Denominated Quickly</h2>

<p>You're not limited to just <a href="http://docs.perl6.org/type/Int">Ints</a> for both
the invocant and the divisors, but can use others too. In this mode, regular division and not integer
one will be used with the divisors and the remainder of the division will
be simply subtracted. Note that this mode is triggered by the invocant not
being an <code>Int</code>, so if it is, simply coerce it into a
<a href="http://docs.perl6.org/type/Rat">Rat</a>, a <a href="http://docs.perl6.org/type/Num">Num</a>,
or anything else that <code>does</code> the <a href="http://docs.perl6.org/type/Real">Real role</a>:</p>

<pre><code>say ‚Öî.polymod: ‚Öì;

say 5.Rat.polymod: .3, .2;
say 3.Rat.polymod: ‚Öî, ‚Öì;

# OUTPUT:
# (0 2)
# (0.2 0 80)
# (0.333333 0 12)
</code></pre>

<p>In the first call, our invocant is already a <code>Rat</code>, so we can just call
<code>.polymod</code> and be done with it. In the second and third, we start off with
Ints, so we coerce them into Rats. The reason I didn't use a Num here is
because it adds <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21895756/why-are-floating-point-numbers-inaccurate">floating point math noise</a> into the results, which Rats can often avoid:</p>

<pre><code>say 5.Num.polymod: .3, .2;
say 3.Num.polymod: ‚Öî, ‚Öì;

# OUTPUT:
# (0.2 0.199999999999999 79)
# (0.333333333333333 2.22044604925031e-16 12)
</code></pre>

<p>This imprecision of floating point math is also something to be very careful
about when using lazy list mode of <code>.polymod</code>, since it may never reach exact
zero (at least <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128175">at the time of this writing</a>). For example, on my machine this is a nearly infinite loop
as the numbers fluctuate wildly. Change <code>put</code> to <code>say</code> to print the first
hundred numbers:</p>

<pre><code>put 4343434343.Num.polymod: ‚Öì xx ‚àû
</code></pre>

<h2 id="makingithuman">Making it Human</h2>

<p>All we've seen so far is nice and useful, but Less Than Awesome when we want
to present the results to squishy humans. Even if we use the Zip meta operator
to add the units, we're still not handling the differences between singular
and plural names for units, for example. Luckily, some crazy guy wrote a module
to help us: <a href="http://modules.perl6.org/repo/Number::Denominate">Number::Denominate</a>.</p>

<pre><code>use Number::Denominate;

my $seconds = 1 * 60*60*24 # days
            + 3 * 60*60    # hours
            + 4 * 60       # minutes
            + 5;           # seconds

say denominate $seconds;
say denominate $seconds, :set&lt;weight&gt;;

# OUTPUT:
# 1 day, 3 hours, 4 minutes, and 5 seconds
# 97 kilograms and 445 grams
</code></pre>

<p>By default, the module uses time units and the first call to
<code>denominate</code> gives us a nice, pretty string. Several
<a href="https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-Number-Denominate#set">sets of units</a>
are pre-defined and in the second call we use the weight unit set.</p>

<p>You can even define your own units:</p>

<pre><code>say denominate 449, :units( foo =&gt; 3, &lt;bar boors&gt; =&gt; 32, 'ber' );

# OUTPUT:
# 4 foos, 2 boors, and 1 ber
</code></pre>

<p>The module offers precision control and a couple of other options,
and I encourage you
to check out <a href="https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-Number-Denominate#synopsis">the docs</a> if denominating things is what you commonly do.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Perl 6's built-in <code>.polymod</code> method is a powerful tool for breaking up
numbers into denominations. You can use it on Ints or other types of numbers, with latter allowing for use of non-integer divisors. You can alter the mode of its operation by providing the divisors as an infinite list. Lastly,
module <code>Number::Denominate</code> can assist with presenting your denominated number
in a human-friendly fashion.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
