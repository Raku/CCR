    2016-09-22 <span class="words-count">| 1998 words |</span> Discussion about roast coverage of Rakudo compiler</p>
  <p>One of the more recent features of <a href="http://www.moarvm.org/">MoarVM</a>
(Perl 6's leading virtual machine) is the coverage reporter created by
<a href="https://twitter.com/loltimo">Timo Paulssen</a>. In fact, it's still experimental
and lives in its own branch. So today, I'll talk about how to build it and use
it, as well as how you can give a helping hand to the Perl 6 development.</p>

<h2 id="parti:weneedtotalkaboutyourtpsreports">Part I: We Need To Talk About Your TPS Reports</h2>

<p>As I've mentioned, coverage reporting is experimental, so many of the
conditionals and individual lines may be wrong. What is mostly correct are the
subs and methods. And you can help us out by writing tests for the uncovered
ones!</p>

<p>There are several ways to get your hands on the core coverage report...</p>

<h3 id="perl6.wtfhttp:perl6.wtf"><a href="http://perl6.WTF/">perl6.WTF</a></h3>

<p>First, you don't have to build or run anything... I did it for you! You can
view the current coverage status at <a href="http://perl6.WTF">perl6.WTF</a>. At its
current state, I don't really have the infrastructure to update this
continuously, because to do it right, we have to run stresstest a couple of
times, so be sure to check the built-on date at the top of the page. I'll
try to run it at least once a day.</p>

<h3 id="undercoverrobots">Undercover Robots</h3>

<p>I've also built a bot called <code>Undercover</code>. It's in both
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6">#perl6</a> and
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6-dev">#perl6-dev</a> IRC channels,
but if you want to run more than just a few commands, join in to the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#zofbot">#zofbot</a> channel, so you don't
annoy anyone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>&lt;Zoffix&gt;</b> c: &amp;pairs, (@ = ^10)<br>
  <b>&lt;Undercover&gt;</b> Zoffix, The code is NOT hit during stresstest See http://perl6.WTF/src_core_â€‹Any.pm.coverage.html#L464 for details<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bot is triggered with <code>c:</code> trigger and takes the same input as my other
<code>SourceBaby</code> robot, which is the arguments to the <a href="https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-CoreHackers-Sourcery#subroutines"><code>sourcery</code> subroutine of
my CoreHackers::Sourcery module</a>.</p>

<p>If the arguments you gave locate a proper Callable, the bot will provide
a link to its coverage report.</p>

<h3 id="buildityourself">Build It Yourself</h3>

<p>You can also build the coverage reporter yourself, so that you can run it any
time you want and get the up-to-date version.</p>

<p>First, you may be reading this article far in the future enough that the
coverage branch is already included in master MoarVM. You can check it by
running:</p>

<pre><code>moar --help | grep COVER
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you're in a Rakudo's build directory, by running:</p>

<pre><code>install/bin/moar --help | grep COVER
</code></pre>

<p>If this or similar line shows up, the coverage support is already there:</p>

<pre><code>MVM_COVERAGE_LOG            Append line-by-line coverage messages to this file
</code></pre>

<p>If not, no worries, we'll build it. Here's a script that can do it. This builds
Rakudo in <code>~/coverakudo</code> and generates the coverage HTML report in
<code>~/coverakudo/coverage/index.html</code></p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# print out the commands we run and bail out on failures
set -x
set -e

# Check out rakudo into ~/coverakudo. You can change it to any dir you want
git clone https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo ~/coverakudo

# go to that dir
cd ~/coverakudo

# Configure
perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --gen-nqp --backends=moar

# Disable the optimizer, so routines we want don't get optimized away
perl -pi -e 's/--optimize=\K3/off/' Makefile

# Build Rakudo
make

# Install Rakudo
make install

# Go to MoarVM dir
cd nqp/MoarVM

# Check out the branch with coverage support
git checkout $(git branch -r | grep origin/line_based_coverage | tail -n1)

# Bring in any latest MoarVM changes from master
git pull --rebase https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/

# Configure MoarVM
perl Configure.pl --prefix=../../install/

# Build MoarVM
make

# Install MoarVM
make install

# Go back to rakudo dir
cd ../..

# Just check that we've got coverage now. Should say "WE SUCCEEDED!!"
install/bin/moar --help | grep MVM_COVERAGE_LOG                 &amp;&amp;
      echo 'We SUCCEEDED!!'                                     ||
    { echo 'WE FAILED!!!!'; exit 1; }

# The following steps download `panda` package manager and install
# Inline::Perl5 module that we need for Rakudo stress testing. You may need
# a specially-built Perl 5 for it. You can use `perlbrew` to obtain it.
# See instructions at https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5#building
git clone https://github.com/tadzik/panda
export PATH=`pwd`/install/bin:$PATH
cd panda; perl6 bootstrap.pl
cd ..
export PATH=`pwd`/install/share/perl6/site/bin:$PATH
panda install Inline::Perl5

# Delete coverage directory, if it's there already
rm -fr coverage

# Create coverage dir; we'll store our coverage report here
mkdir coverage

# Turn off auto-bail-out, since stresstests may fail and that's OK
set +e

# Run stresstest. The MVM_COVERAGE_LOG var tells MoarVM where to store
# coverage report files; the `%d` in the filename is necessary to store
# the process IDs of running tests!
MVM_COVERAGE_LOG='coverage/cover-%d' TEST_JOBS=8 make stresstest

#########################
## Note: at least on my box, some stresstest flapped and exited early,
## because apparently disabling the optimizer changes the test results.
## For that reason, to get full coverage either run the stresstest
## several times, or run individual failing test files a few times with
## MVM_COVERAGE_LOG='coverage/cover-%d' make t/spec/THE-TEST-FILE.t
## some test files may end with `.rakudo.moar` extension. Change it to `.t`
#########################

# Bail out on fail
set -e

# Go into directory with all the coverage files
cd coverage

# Find entries we want, make sure they're unique, and store them all in
# a file. This step may take awhile to run, especially if you ran the
# entire stresstest several times
cat * | grep 'gen/moar/m-CORE.setting' | sort | uniq &gt; full-cover

# Go back up
cd ../

# Generate the setting annotations
install/bin/moar --dump CORE.setting.moarvm &gt; setting

# Run the coverage report
./perl6 nqp/MoarVM/tools/parse_coverage_report.p6 \
    --annotations=setting coverage/full-cover gen/moar/m-CORE.setting

# It's ready! All of the files are in coverage/ directory and you can
# start viewing them by opening coverage/index.html in your favourite browser
firefox coverage/index.html
</code></pre>

<p>You can also generate coverage reports for arbitrary chunks of code. You can
use the same script, but simply replace this line:</p>

<pre><code>MVM_COVERAGE_LOG='coverage/cover-%d' TEST_JOBS=8 make stresstest
</code></pre>

<p>With this:</p>

<pre><code>MVM_COVERAGE_LOG='coverage/cover-%d' ./perl6 -e 'SOME CODE'
</code></pre>

<p>Or this:</p>

<pre><code>MVM_COVERAGE_LOG='coverage/cover-%d' ./perl6 some-script.p6
</code></pre>

<h2 id="partii:canhasmoarcover">Part II: Can Has Moar Cover?</h2>

<p>While the reports are pretty, we don't want to just stare at them, we want to
improve them!</p>

<p>The <code>t/spec</code> directory in your Rakudo build directory will contain a checkout
of <a href="https://github.com/perl6/roast/">The Official Perl 6 Test Suite or "Roast"</a>.
If you'd like to work on your own fork, just check it out into that directory
and it'll work just the same. Our goal here is to find uncovered subroutines
and methods using the coverage report and add tests for them. Most of the
times, the uncovered versions will be multi candidates that take some uncommon
arguments or handle degenerate cases. We need to find where the rest of the
candidates are tested and add our tests along with them, but before we do,
I want to make something clear:</p>

<h4 id="whatrakudodoesdoesnotdefineperl6">What Rakudo Does Does Not Define Perl 6</h4>

<p>Rakudo is <em>a</em> compiler for the Perl 6 language and the Roast defines what that
language is, not the other way around. Just because a particular method in
Rakudo returns a particular value does not mean that value is correct. So,
keep this in mind, and be suspicious of any weird behaviour. If in doubt
whether the test you're about to write is testing the wrong behaviour,
double-check with the folks in <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6-dev">#perl6-dev channel</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are two techniques that serve well for finding where to put your
tests. First, try to find the name of the routine you want to cover
right in the filename of the test. We can do it by piping the output of
<code>tree -f</code> to <code>grep</code>. Here's a way to find where <code>.splice</code> method is tested:</p>

<pre><code>$ tree -f | grep splice
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ./S32-array/splice.t
</code></pre>

<p>If that fails, try to find the method by grepping over files' contents:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -R '.combinations'
... lots of output ...
S32-list/combinations.t:# L&lt;S32::Containers/List/=item combinations&gt;
... lots of output ...
</code></pre>

<p>For most methods, that will give you an idea of which file is right, otherwise,
try to find the best you can. A test in the wrong file is better than no
test at all.</p>

<p>At the top of the test file, you'll find a plan that indicates how many
tests you're expecting to run:</p>

<pre><code>plan 13;
</code></pre>

<p>Increase it by the number of tests you're adding. As for the tests
themselves, I like to place them at the end of the file, in a separate block
labeled that these are coverage tests:</p>

<pre><code>{ # coverage; 2016-09-21
    is Foo, 'Bar', 'Foo is Bar';
    ...
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, if the tests' validity comes into question in the future, it will
be easy to see that the tests were added as part of coverage, likely based
on Rakudo's behaviour, rather than as part of thinking through of how the
language is meant to work.</p>

<p>Once that is done, check your tests pass. From Rakudo's build directory, run
<code>make t/spec/your-test-file</code>:</p>

<pre><code>make t/spec/S32-list/combinations.t
... lots of output...
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=13,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.03 usr  0.01 sys +  0.64 cusr  0.06 csys =  0.74 CPU)
Result: PASS
</code></pre>

<p>If you do get failures, you can get a more verbose output by
running <code>prove -vlr</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>prove -e './perl6' -vlr t/spec/S32-list/combinations.t
</code></pre>

<p>Once the tests pass, you're ready to commit your changes. I like to prefix
the commit message with <code>[coverage]</code> to indicate these tests are part of
coverage work, but this isn't necessary.</p>

<pre><code>git add S32-list/combinations.t
git commit
</code></pre>

<p>All done!</p>

<h2 id="partiii:thefuture">Part III: The Future!</h2>

<p>Reading the article, you can notice two pain points:</p>

<ul>
<li>I said I don't have infrastructure to run continuous coverage reports
due to large computational requirements</li>
<li>Finding where to add the tests can be a pain, and it's even more difficult
to find where a particular routine candidate is tested</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a way to ameliorate both of those issues. I don't think I'll have the
time to do it, but perhaps there's a willing volunteer in the audience who can
lend a helping hand.</p>

<h3 id="wereyoutested">Were You Tested?</h3>

<p>The way to get the data for where a routine is tested is to run coverage
report <em>per test file</em>. The issue with that is <a href="https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/line_based_coverage_4/tools/parse_coverage_report.p6">the coverage report generator
script</a> takes ages to run. However, most of that time is spent
reading the annotations file, which is the same on each run.</p>

<p>The way to speed up the script is to make it take multiple raw coverage reports
and generate the HTML reports for each of them in separate directories. This
way, the annotations would have to be read just once and we can generate
batches of reports per-stresstest-file.</p>

<p>The next stage would be to make <code>Undercover</code> robot (or any other means) to
go through that batch of reports and see in which reports a particular given
line of code is covered. The result: we get a list of test files that cover
a particular routine!</p>

<h3 id="continuousreports">Continuous reports</h3>

<p>Being able to run continuous reports overlaps a bit with the previous point.
The main issue is to ensure as many tests as possible have ran. If any
of the test files prematurely bail out, we need to re-run them. The current
blunt-force tool for that is to re-run the stresstest several times. On the
server I have available, each run takes 20 minutes, which is less than ideal.</p>

<p>So, if the individual files are tested, and there's a mechanism to re-test
failing files a couple of times, to get rid of flappers, the coverage
reports can then be re-generated continuously and entirely automatically,
when new Rakudo or Roast commits come in.</p>

<h3 id="bettercover">Better Cover</h3>

<p>The reports themselves need improvement. How they work is beyond my current
understanding, so if you're interested in helping with that work, contact
<a href="https://twitter.com/loltimo">Timo Paulssen</a>
(<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#moarvm"><code>timotimo</code> on #moarv channel</a>).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>MoarVM has a new experimental feature to report test coverage for code. The
reports are available on <a href="http://perl6.WTF">perl6.WTF</a>, via <code>Undercover</code> IRC
bot, or you can generate them yourself, by building the coverage MoarVM branch.</p>

<p>We could use volunteers for writing the missing <a href="https://github.com/perl6/roast/">roast</a> tests to improve coverage, improve the performance of
coverage report generator, as well as improve the validity of the coverage
report itself.</p>

<p>There's lots of work to be done and you can be part of our awesome team!
