    2016-01-22 <span class="words-count">| 499 words |</span> Discussion of Rakudo Perl 6 compiler&#39;s implementation.</p>
  <p>Today, I've done something strange.</p>

<p>No, there weren't drugs involved, I merely sent a patch for Rakudo for a bug I reported a few weeks back. But the patch is... interesting.</p>

<p>First, about the "bug." Newest JSON spec lets you have anything as the top level thing. I spotted a few modules in the <a href="http://modules.perl6.org/">Perl 6 ecosystem</a> that still expected an object or an array only, and the vendor-specific (possibly to be made hidden in the future) <code>to-json</code> subroutine provided by core Rakudo behaved the same as well.</p>

<p>One of the modules got fixed right away and today, seeing as there were no takers, I went in to fix the bug in Rakudo myself. Since I'm a lazy bum, I merely went in to that one fixed module and just copied the fix over!</p>

<p>But wait a second... ain't the Perl 6 module written in Perl 6? How did I manage to "just copy it over"? What sorcery is this! Surely you lie, good sir!</p>

<p>Here are the Rakudo and the module patches one above the other. Try to figure out which one is for Rakudo:</p>

<p><img alt="source2.png" src="http://blogs.perl.org/users/zoffix_znet/source2.png" width="532" height="904" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>Give up yet? The code above the black bar is the <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/687/files">patch made in JSON::Tiny module</a> and the code below it is the <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/687/files">patch I made for Rakudo</a>.</p>

<p>As surprising and amazing as it is, most of Perl 6 is actually written in Perl 6! The <a href="https://github.com/perl6/nqp">NQP (Not Quite Perl)</a> provides the bricks and the mortar, but when it comes to the drywall, paint, and floorboards, you're full in the Perl 6 territory.</p>

<h2 id="sowhatdoesthisallmean">So what does this all mean?</h2>

<p>I'm not a genius programmer and I'm quite new to Perl 6 too, but I was able to send in a patch <em>for the Perl 6 compiler</em> that fixes something. And it's not even the first time <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/635/files">I sent some Perl 6 code</a> to improve Rakudo. Each one of the <strong>actual users of Perl 6</strong> can fix bugs, add features, and do optimizations. For the most part, there's no need to learn some new arcane thing to hack on the innards of the compiler.</p>

<p>Imagine if to fix your car or to make it more fuel efficient, all you had to do was learn how to drive; if to rewire your house, all you had to do is learn how to turn on TV or a toaster; if to become a chef, all you had to do was enjoy a savory steak once in a while. And not only the users of Perl 6 are the potential guts hackers, they also have <em>direct interest</em> in making the compiler better.</p>

<p>So to the <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jt_smith/2016/01/perl-6s-killer-app---async.html">speculations on the potential Perl 6 Killer App</a>, I'll add that one of the Perl 6's killer apps is Perl 6 itself. And for those wishing to add <em>"programming a compiler"</em> onto their résumés, simply clone <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">the Rakudo repo</a> and go to town on it... there are <a href="http://rt.perl.org">plenty of bugs to squish</a>.</p>
