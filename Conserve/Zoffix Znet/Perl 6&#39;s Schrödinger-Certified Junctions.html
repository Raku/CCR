    2016-09-05 <span class="words-count">| 1045 words |</span> Using Junction types in Perl 6</p>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a> would
have loved Perl 6, because the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">cat
gedanken</a> can be
expressed in a Perl 6 <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Junction">Junction</a>:</p>

<pre><code>my $cat = 'dead' | 'alive';
say "cat is both dead and alive" if $cat eq 'dead' and $cat eq 'alive';

# OUTPUT:
# cat is both dead and alive
</code></pre>

<p>What's happening here? I'll tell ya all about it!</p>

<h2 id="anyonegame">Anyone game?</h2>

<p>At their simplest, Junctions let you treat a bunch of values as a single one.
For example, you can use an <code>any</code> Junction to test if a variable equals
to any of the given values:</p>

<pre><code>say 'it matches!' if 'foo' eq 'foo' | 'bar' | 'ber';

say 'single-digit prime' if 5 == any ^9 .grep: *.is-prime;

my @values = ^100;
say ’it's in 'ere!‘ if 42 == @values.any;

# OUTPUT:
# it matches!
# single-digit prime
# it's in 'ere!
</code></pre>

<p>To create an <code>any</code> Junction from a bunch of values, you can use the <code>|</code> infix
operator, call the <code>any</code> function, or use the <code>.any</code> method. The conditionals
above will return True if <code>any</code> of the values in a Junction match the given
one. In fact, nothing's stopping you from using a Junction on both ends:</p>

<pre><code>my @one = 1..10;
my @two = 5..15;
say ’there's overlap!‘ if @one.any == @two.any;

# OUTPUT:
# there's overlap!
</code></pre>

<p>The operator will return True if <code>.any</code> of the values in <code>@one</code> numerically
equal to <code>.any</code> of the values in <code>@two</code>. Pretty sweet, but we can do more.</p>

<h2 id="allforoneandanyfornone">All for One and Any for None</h2>

<p>The <code>any</code> Junction isn't the only one available. You have a choice of
<code>all</code>, <code>any</code>, <code>one</code>, and <code>none</code>.  When collapsing into Boolean context, their
meaning is as follows; function/method names to construct the Junction
are the same as the name of the Junction itself and the infix operators to
construct the Junction are listed below as well:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>all</code>—<em>all</em> values evaluate to True (use infix <code>&amp;</code>)</li>
<li><code>any</code>—<em>at least one</em> of the values evaluate to True (use infix <code>|</code>)</li>
<li><code>one</code>—<em>exactly one</em> of the values evaluate to True (use infix <code>^</code>)</li>
<li><code>none</code>—<em>none</em> of the values evaluate to True (no infix available)</li>
</ul>

<p>Take special care when using the <code>all</code> Junction:</p>

<pre><code>my @values = 2, 3, 5;
say 'all primes' if @values.all ~~ *.is-prime;

my @moar-values;
say 'also all primes' if @moar-values.all ~~ *.is-prime;
</code></pre>

<p>It will return <code>True</code> even when it has no values, which may not be what
you intended. In those cases, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>my @moar-values;
say 'also all primes' if @moar-values and @moar-values.all ~~ *.is-prime;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="callmebaby">Call Me, Baby</h2>

<p>You can use Junctions as arguments to Routines that don't expect them. What
happens then? The Routine will be called with each Junctioned value, and the
return will be a Junction:</p>

<pre><code>sub calculate-things ($n) {
    say "$n is a prime"        if $n.is-prime;
    say "$n is an even number" if $n %% 2;
    say "$n is pretty big"     if $n &gt; 1e6;
    $n²;
}

my @values = 1, 5, 42, 1e10.Int;
say 'EXACTLY ONE square is larger than 1e10'
    if 1e10 &lt; calculate-things @values.one;

# OUTPUT:
# 5 is a prime
# 42 is an even number
# 10000000000 is an even number
# 10000000000 is pretty big
# EXACTLY ONE square is larger than 1e10
</code></pre>

<p>Exploiting side-effects might be a bit too magical and not something you'd
want to see in production code, but using a subroutine to alter the original
Junctioned value is quite acceptable. How about performing a database lookup
to obtain the "actual" value and then evaluating the conditional:</p>

<pre><code>use v6;
use DBIish;
my $dbh = DBIish.connect: 'SQLite', :database&lt;test.db&gt;;

sub lookup ($id) {
    given $dbh.prepare: 'SELECT id, text FROM stuff WHERE id = ?' {
        .execute: $id;
        .allrows[0][1] // '';
    }
}

my @ids = 3, 5, 10;
say 'yeah, it got it, bruh' if 'meow' eq lookup @ids.any;

# OUTPUT (the database has a row with id = 5 and text = 'meow'):
# yeah, it got it, bruh
</code></pre>

<h2 id="wevebeenexpectingyou.pleasehaveaseat.">We've been expecting you. Please, have a seat.</h2>

<p>The game changes when your Routine explicitly expects a Junction</p>

<pre><code>sub do-stuff (Junction $n) {
    say 'value is even'  if $n %% 2;
    say 'value is prime' if $n.is-prime;
    say 'value is large' if $n &gt; 1e10;
}

do-stuff (2, 3, 1e11.Int).one;
say '---';
do-stuff (2, 3, 1e11.Int).any;

# OUTPUT:
# value is large
# ---
# value is even
# value is prime
# value is large
</code></pre>

<p>When we provide a <code>one</code> Junction, only the conditions that satisfy exactly
<em>one</em> of the given values trigger. When we provide an <code>any</code> Junction, they
trigger when any of the given values satisfy the condition.</p>

<p>But! You don't have to wait for the world to hand out Junctions for you.
How about you make one yourself, and save up on code when testing the conditions:</p>

<pre><code>sub do-stuff (*@v) {
    my $n = @v.one;
    say "$n is even"  if $n %% 2;
    say "$n is prime" if $n.is-prime;
    say "$n is large" if $n &gt; 1e10;
}

do-stuff 2, 3, 1e11.Int;
say '---';
do-stuff 42;

# OUTPUT:
# one(2, 3, 100000000000) is large
# ---
# one(42) is even
</code></pre>

<h2 id="wontsomeonethinkofthefuture">Won't Someone Think of The Future?</h2>

<p>Here's a little secret: Junctions are designed to be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_parallelization">auto-threaded</a>. Even
though at the time of this writing they will use just one thread, you should
not rely on them being executed in any predictable order. The auto-threading
will be implemented by some time in 2018, so stay tuned... your complex
Junctioned operations that deserve it might get much faster in a couple
of years without you doing anything.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Perl 6 Junctions are superpositions of values that let you test multiple
values as if they were one. Apart from offering fantastically short and readable
syntax for doing so, Junctions also pack a punch by letting you use
Routines to transform the superimposed values or make use of the side effects.</p>

<p>You can also make routines that explicitly operate on Junctions or transform
the multiple provided values <em>into</em> Junctions to simplify your code.</p>

<p>Lastly, Junctions are designed to use all of the available power your computer
offers and will be made autothreaded in the short future.</p>

<p>Junctions are awesome! Use them. And have fun!</p>
