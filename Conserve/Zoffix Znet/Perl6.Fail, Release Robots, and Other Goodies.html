    2016-09-17 <span class="words-count">| 2069 words |</span> Description of work done to automate Perl 6 releases</p>
  <p><em>Deconfusion note: if you're just a regular Perl 6 user, you likely use
and only ever heard of Rakudo Star, which is a distribution that includes
the Rakudo Perl 6 Compiler, some modules, and the docs. This post details a release
of that compiler</em> <strong>only,</strong> <em>which gets released more often than Rakudo Star.
So please don't think there's a new release, if Star is all you use.</em></p>

<p>If you follow <a href="http://perl6.party">what I write</a>, you know that last month
I messed up a Perl 6 release and vowed to <a href="/post/I-Botched-A-Perl-6-Release-And-Now-A-Robot-Is-Taking-My-Job">improve the
process</a>,
by making a release robot. Well, I didn't lie!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>* Zoffix</b> dissapears for a couple of weeks<br>
  <b>&lt;Zoffix&gt;</b> Can be reached via twitter if needed<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I popped in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eRgh-dNjAk">some relaxing
music</a> and
got cracking. Today, I'll talk about the goodies I've made, which touch
a much broader scope than just releasing Perl 6.</p>

<p>Let the gift unwrapping begin!</p>

<h2 id="perl6.fail:r6isthenewrt">Perl6.Fail: R6 Is The New RT</h2>

<p>First thing I needed was a web app where a release manager could view new
bug tickets since last release and mark them as release-blockers, if needed.
The app needs to keep track of what tickets were already reviewed, so the
release manager can spend just a couple of minutes of their time every few
days, instead of cramming everything into a single sitting on release date.</p>

<p>I named that app <strong>R6</strong>.
The six fits the Perl 6 theme, and <code>6</code> is above <code>T</code>
on the keyboard, which I found apropos, since my app is better than
<a href="https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker">stock RT</a> we currently use ðŸ˜œ.
With the name for the bug app in place, I went to hunt for neat domain names to
host it on and nearly immediately found the perfectest one:
<strong><a href="http://perl6.fail">perl6.fail</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Helping release managers is the smaller side of the utility of the app and
it aims to address some of the major pain points with RT (or rather with our
particular instance of RT that we also have to share with Perl 5).</p>

<h3 id="viewingtags">Viewing Tags</h3>

<p>The RT version has <a href="/post/A-Date-With-The-Bug-Queue-or-Let-Me-Help-You-Help-Me-Help-You--Part-2#lesson4:tagyourticketsandmakethemeasytofind">overly complicated
interface</a> when it comes to trying
to find a ticket tagged with a particular tag. Worse still, some tags
are just special codes in ticket subject lines, while others use the actual
tag interface. Annoying!</p>

<p>This is one of the first things I solved in R6. The home page lists all
available tags, along with ticket counts for each tag. Simply clicking the
tag will show the tickets just for that tag.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/pics/release-robots/r6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Simple. Just the way it's supposed to be.</p>

<h3 id="searchinganddecenteditor">Searching and Decent Editor</h3>

<p>Once I get more tuits, I plan to also add full-text ticket search and a
decent Markdown editor for ticket replies.</p>

<h3 id="releasemanagers">Release Managers</h3>

<p>If you log in as a release manager, you get extra bells and whistles in the
interface that let you mark tickets as was the original plan, as well as
mark commits as reviewed, when updating changelog.</p>

<h3 id="api">API</h3>

<p>The release robot has to fetch info from this app to know whether all tickets
and commits have been reviewed. As such,
<a href="http://perl6.fail/t/BUG.json">adding <code>.json</code> to the URL</a>
of most pages will cause the app provide output in JSON format, rather than
plain ol' HTML.</p>

<p>Speaking of robots...</p>

<h2 id="buggable">Buggable</h2>

<p>Some of you have already seen my prototype bot <code>buggable</code>. It
was... well, let's just say the name suits it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>&lt;buggable&gt;</b> â˜  [travis build above] One job failed but NOT due to the timeout.<br>
  <b>&lt;lizmat&gt;</b> &quot;No output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.&quot;<br>
  <b>&lt;lizmat&gt;</b> sounds like timeout to me<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>&lt;buggable&gt;</b> geekosaur, Found 2 tickets tagged with STAR.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Details: http://bug.perl6.party/1470861574.html<br>
  <b>&lt;geekosaur&gt;</b> o.O<br>
  <b>&lt;geekosaur&gt;</b> buggable appears to have a math problem<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, I fixed the Travis bogus-failure watcher and taught it to handle
missing build logs and GitHub connectivity issues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>&lt;buggable&gt;</b> [travis build above] âœ“ All failures are due to timeout (0),<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    missing build log (1), or GitHub connectivity (0)<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for tags and tickets, I completely threw away the old backend that used
RT API and its own database. Instead, the bot now uses the API of the R6
app I made.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>&lt;Zoffix&gt;</b> buggable, tags<br>
  <b>&lt;buggable&gt;</b> Zoffix, <strong>Total: 439;</strong> <strong>BUG:</strong> 189; <strong>UNTAGGED:</strong> 58; <strong>LTA:</strong> 54; <strong>RFC:</strong> 40;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <strong>CONC:</strong> 20; <strong>SEGV:</strong> 18; <strong>JVM:</strong> 14; <strong>UNI:</strong> 13; <strong>PERF:</strong> 12; <strong>TESTNEEDED:</strong> 12; <strong>POD:</strong> 9;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <strong>PRECOMP:</strong> 9; <strong>@LARRY:</strong> 7; <strong>NATIVECALL:</strong> 7; <strong>NYI:</strong> 6; <strong>IO:</strong> 5; <strong>REGEX:</strong> 5; <strong>BUILD:</strong> 3;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <strong>MATH:</strong> 3; <strong>REPL:</strong> 3; <strong>GLR:</strong> 2; <strong>OSX:</strong> 2; <strong>WEIRD:</strong> 2; <strong>BOOTSTRAP:</strong> 1; <strong>CONFIGURE:</strong> 1;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <strong>OO:</strong> 1; <strong>RT:</strong> 1; <strong>SITE:</strong> 1; <strong>SPEC:</strong> 1; <strong>STAR:</strong> 1; <strong>TESTCOMMITTED:</strong> 1;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    See <a href="http://perl6.fail/">http://perl6.fail/</a> for details<br>
  <b>&lt;Zoffix&gt;</b> buggable, tag bug,rfc<br>
  <b>&lt;buggable&gt;</b> Zoffix, There are <strong>2 tickets</strong> tagged with <strong>BUG, RFC</strong>;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    See <a href="http://perl6.fail/t/BUG,RFC">http://perl6.fail/t/BUG,RFC</a> for details<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only all the issues are gone, it now picks up the proper RT tags too and
not just the ones in the subject line. You can specify multiple tags with a
comma, to find tickets with a combination of tags.</p>

<p>Once ticket search is implemented in R6, <code>buggable</code> will be able to search for
tickets, which can be handy in-chat when trying to decide whether something
was or needs to be rakudobugged.</p>

<h2 id="neuralanomaly">NeuralAnomaly</h2>

<p>Finally, I'm proud to present the star of the hour and the newest member of the
release team: <code>NeuralAnomaly</code>. It graciously made the release of the Rakudo
Perl 6 Compiler this month, successfully replacing me at the job:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>&lt;Zoffix&gt;</b> NeuralAnomaly, yo<br>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="thetech">The Tech</h2>

<p>The code for all of the deliverables is <a href="https://github.com/zoffixznet">available on
GitHub</a>, in <a href="https://github.com/zoffixznet/r6">R6
repo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-buggable">Buggable
repo</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/zoffixznet/na">NeuralAnomaly
repo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="r6">R6</h3>

<p>The R6 app uses <a href="https://rt-wiki.bestpractical.com/wiki/REST">RT's REST API</a>
to ask the running RT instance for updated tickets every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>I chose Perl 5 as the weapon of choice, utilizing the talents of
the <a href="http://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious web framework</a> and
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class"><code>DBIx::Class</code> ORM</a>.</p>

<p>I attempted to
use <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/RT::Client::REST"><code>RT::Client::REST</code></a> for API
interfacing, but found the module oddly designed and requiring too many
requests to obtain information I needed. So I implemented the
relevant portions of the RT's REST API interface myself.</p>

<p>For user accounts, I <s>stole</s> borrowed, <code>RT::Client::REST</code> authentication
mechanism, although at the time of this writing, no user-account features
are available to users (and perl6.fail still runs on plain HTTP). And
Will "Coke" Coleda was very helpful in pointing out a relevant portion of the
API that let me save making a huge number of requests. And current
implementation makes
just a single request every 10 minutes, asking only for updated tickets since
last request.</p>

<h3 id="buggable">Buggable</h3>

<p>The bot uses my very own <a href="https://modules.perl6.org/dist/IRC::Client"><code>IRC::Client</code> Perl 6 module</a>
and is pretty thin
and isn't much to look at. Using <a href="https://modules.perl6.org/dist/JSON::Fast"><code>JSON::Fast</code></a> and <a href="https://modules.perl6.org/dist/HTTP::UserAgent"><code>HTTP::UserAgent</code></a>
modules it accesses <a href="http://perl6.fail">R6</a> using its JSON endpoints to fetch
the tag info and perform ticket searches.</p>

<p>Travis features use <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/api">Travis API</a>. Since the
stuff I use does not require authentication, this is nothing more than
fetching data from an endpoint and decoding JSON.
I found <a href="http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/">JSONViewer.Stack.Hu</a> helpful when
figuring out what bits of data I wanted to keep.</p>

<h3 id="neuralanomaly">NeuralAnomaly</h3>

<p>When I planned this bot, I suspected developing it would be somewhat difficult,
with lots of thinking... In reality, <em>writing code for it</em>
turned out to be super easy.
Popping <code>ssh</code> into <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Proc::Async"><code>Proc::Async</code></a>
was child's play, and the Proc bailed out on non-zero exit codes, which made
it super easy for me to abort failing stages of the process. I basically
ended up with Perl-6-super-charged bash scripts... quite literally:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/pics/release-robots/perl6-bash.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, when it came to giving <code>gpg</code> and <code>git tag</code> the passphrase for the
key, that... is worth its own section.</p>

<h4 id="wontyoutakemypassphraseplease"><em>Won't You Take My Passphrase Please</em></h4>

<p>The major roadblock was trying to pass
the GPG passphrase to the <code>gpg</code> (which was easy) and to the <code>git</code> when signing
the tag (which got annoying quick).</p>

<p>Avoiding <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11270814">idiotic solutions that tell you to write your passphrase
into world-readable files</a>, I went
to enable the <code>gpg-agent</code> by installing <code>gnupg-agent</code>, uncommenting
<code>use-agent</code> in <code>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>,
and running <code>eval $(gpg-agent --daemon --sh)</code></p>

<p>That did the trick with starting the agent, <em>but</em> <code>git tag</code> was now outright
choking when attempting to sign, telling me <code>'gpg: cancelled by user'</code>,
even though
I did naught.</p>

<p>After several hours of trying things and getting a helping hand from mst,
the solution was nowhere in sight:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/pics/release-robots/mst.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, after installing a program called <code>unbuffer</code>
(<code>sudo apt-get install expect-dev</code>), reading its help page, and
inserting an appropriate amount of sleeps, I ended up with these
chunks of code in my release bot that seemed to do the trick when passing
them to commands requiring keys:</p>

<pre><code>constant $with-github-credentials is export
    = "(sleep 6; echo -e '$github-user\\n';"
    ~ " sleep 6; echo -e '$github-pass\\n'; sleep 12) | unbuffer -p";

constant $with-gpg-passphrase     is export
    = "(sleep 6; echo '$gpg-keyphrase'; sleep 12) | unbuffer -p";

...

gpg --batch --no-tty --passphrase-fd 0 -b \\
    --armor rakudo-$rakudo-ver.tar.gz                           ||
\{ echo '$na-fail Rakudo: Sign the tarball'; exit 1; \}
$gpg-keyphrase

...

$with-github-credentials git push
</code></pre>

<p>Echoing like that is not ideal, but this is running in a single-user VM, so
it'll do for now.</p>

<p>The remaining bits of the scripting were easy.</p>

<h4 id="steprightup">Step Right Up</h4>

<p>After completing full release scripts for NQP and Rakudo and ensuring they
work, it was time to break them. If a single spectest test fails in
final tarball testing due to being floppy, you don't want to repeat the whole
process from scratch. So I broke up release scripts into bite-size pieces
and made the bot able to run individual pieces on command.</p>

<p>That had a positive unintended effect:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>&lt;Zoffix&gt;</b> NeuralAnomaly, run pre r-clone r-build r-p5 r-stress r-stress-v6c<br>
  <b>&lt;NeuralAnomaly&gt;</b> Zoffix, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Prep done<br>
  <b>&lt;NeuralAnomaly&gt;</b> Zoffix, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Rakudo stresstest (master) OK<br>
  <b>&lt;NeuralAnomaly&gt;</b> â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Rakudo stresstest (6.c-errata) OK<br>
  <b>&lt;NeuralAnomaly&gt;</b> â™¥â™¥â™¥ All Done! â™¥â™¥â™¥<br>
  <b>&lt;Zoffix&gt;</b> :D<br>
  <b>&lt;Zoffix&gt;</b> So the release bot doubles as a stresstester too :)<br></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>

<p>The most <strike>difficult</strike> annoying phase was testing. Not only
does the full build runs for about 40 minutes even on my 24-core VM, but I
had to delete and then re-clone both NQP and Rakudo repos, because their state
had to be pristine.</p>

<p>After countless hours and hundreds of Rakudos built, I can now recite the build
process with my eyes closed :)</p>

<h2 id="thefuture">The Future</h2>

<p>All of these goodies burnt me out a bitâ€”stuff started to feel like "work"
rather than enjoyment. It wasn't the code, but the testing. There's nothing
quite like 40-minute test sessions, where a single typo sends you to square
one. So I plan to take the next month or so "off," working on other
things in Rakudo. But eventually, I plan to improve both R6 and the release
robot.</p>

<p>Currently, the bot does not send email announcements and I've not even checked
whether Wikipedia has an API to make automated updates. R6 also has a ton of
improvement potential by allowing to view and comment on existing tickets, as
well as provide useful search features.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This month, Perl 6's release cycle received an awesome upgrade: release steps
got abstracted into commands to be issued to an IRC bot. More to it, release
managers no longer have to cram all of their work into a single day, but are
now free to spread it out throughout the month.</p>

<p>The new website <a href="http://perl6.fail">perl6.fail</a> makes it easy to locate
tickets tagged with a particular tag and will be eventually expanded into a
more usable bug tracker interface.</p>

<p>More than getting just the release robot, the Perl 6 development team now
also has a spectest robot that will regularly "practice" doing releases,
spotting any of the issues much sooner than previously was possible.</p>

<p>Things got better.</p>
