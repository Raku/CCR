    2016-01-20 <span class="words-count">| 846 words |</span> Attempting to answer most commonly asked Python StackOverflow questions in Perl 6.</p>
  <p>As a Perl 5 programmer of about a decade, I'm well aware of how it was referred to at some point or another as the "write-only" and "linenoise" language. With the newest addition of the baby Perl 6 language to the Perl family, I fear that I must <s>declare</s> (wildly speculate) based on my <s>extensive research</s> (a boring ride on a bus, while staring at my phone) that Python steals that title now!!</p>

<p>Why Python? Blame whoever made the <a href="http://python-weekly.blogspot.ca/2016/01/ii-stackoverflow-python-report.html">Stackoverflow Python Report</a> scroll through my Twitter feed. I merely picked two problems from that list and asked myself what would the Perl 6 solutions to them look like.</p>

<h2 id="interleavetwostrings">Interleave Two Strings</h2>

<p>The top rated item of the week is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34756145/most-pythonic-way-to-interleave-two-strings">interleaving two strings</a>.</p>

<pre><code>#Given:
u = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
l = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

#Wanted:
'AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHhIiJjKkLlMmNnOoPpQqRrSsTtUuVvWwXxYyZz'
</code></pre>

<p>The accepted Python answer is this:</p>

<pre><code>res = "".join(i + j for i, j in zip(u, l))
print(res)
</code></pre>

<p>Certainly isn't bad, but using a two-variable postfix <code>for</code> loop inside a method call is something I wouldn't want to read in code very often. Let's examine the Perl 6 version:</p>

<pre><code>say join '', (u.comb Z l.comb)
</code></pre>

<p>Just like the Python version, we're utilizing the <code>join()</code>, but the rest looks certainly cleaner: we're using the <code>.comb</code> method on our two strings, which without arguments returns characters in a string, and we combine them with the <code>Z</code> zip operator. That is it! No loops needed. (And before someone points it out, no, I haven't missed any sigils. Perl 6 can have sigilless vars, baby).</p>

<h2 id="round-robinmergetwolistsofdifferentlength">Round-Robin Merge Two Lists of Different Length</h2>

<p>Another interesting item on the list is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34692738/merge-lists-in-python-by-placing-every-nth-item-from-one-list-and-others-from-an">round-robin merge of two different-length lists</a>. There isn't an accepted answer to the question, so I'll go with the highest-voted:</p>

<pre><code>list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
list2 = ['x', 'y']
n = 3

iter1 = iter(list1)
res = []
for x in list2:
    res.extend([next(iter1) for _ in range(n - 1)])
    res.append(x)
res.extend(iter1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; res
['a', 'b', 'x', 'c', 'd', 'y', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
</code></pre>

<p>I see a <code>for</code> loop, and another <code>for</code> loop, <code>.extend</code> method and then <code>.append</code> method and after another <code>.extend</code> after the outer <code>for</code> loop, voilà! Result.</p>

<p>Being a Perl 6 noob, I first reached for the trusty <code>Z</code> operator, then I messed with the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/tutorial/perl6-hyper-operators">Hyper Operators</a>, and all I got in return were either wrong solutions or messy solutions... Until someone pointed out that Perl 6 actually has a <a href="http://docs.perl6.org/routine/roundrobin"><code>roundrobin</code> routine</a>! So what's the Perl 6 answer?</p>

<pre><code>my @list1 = 'a' .. 'h';
my @list2 = &lt;x y&gt;;
say flat roundrobin @list1, @list2;

# &gt;&gt;&gt;
# OUTPUT«a x b y c d e f g h»
</code></pre>

<p>On the first two lines, we're simply creating two variables for our lists. <code>@list1</code> uses a range with letters and <code>@list2</code> uses the quote word construct. I'm sure similar things exist in Python too, so I won't count clarity and ease-of-writing points for those, but the rest of the code is rather different. There are no loops, extends, or appends. We use the <code>roundrobin</code> routine to... surprise... round-robin through the two lists. Now, it returns a <code>Seq</code> of <code>List</code>s, which is why I added the <code>flat</code> routine as well, to flatten the output to what the Python answer returns.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> as one of the commenters pointed out, I wasn't paying much attention to this one and completely missed the "nth element" requirement. Never fear, however, the alternate requirement only needs the addition of trusty <a href="http://docs.perl6.org/routine/rotor"><code>.rotor</code> List method</a> that breaks up a list into sublists:</p>

<pre><code>my @list1 = 'a' .. 'h';
my @list2 = &lt;x y&gt;;
my $n = 3;
say flat roundrobin @list1.rotor($n - 1, :partial), @list2;

# &gt;&gt;&gt;
# OUTPUT«a b x c d y e f g h»
</code></pre>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This post is, of course, a tongue-in-cheek joshing, based on a random post I saw on Twitter. However, on a more serious and deeper note, it does seem that the brand-new language like Perl 6 that has an actual language specification, when compared to an old grandpa specless language like Python, seems to offer built-in methods, operators, and subroutines specifically geared to real-world problems that—for however short a period of time—made it to the top of a popular programming question website.</p>

<p>And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SyUFO9X_TU">silly YouTube video</a> declaring Python to be the new "Write-only, Linenoise" language. Sorry, Perl. You lose.</p>

<h2 id="update1">Update 1</h2>

<p>As I'm not the one to shyly sit in a silo, I went to #python on irc.freenode.net and asked for feedback on this article, and it's this:</p>

<p>In the first example, the use of the for loop is extremely idiomatic Python, so the code is perfectly readable to a competent Python programmer. As for the second Python example, the general opinion was that it's overly-complex and I did see a simple 1-line round-robin example presented to me in-channel. The nth element variant may be dropped to me on Twitter as well in the future :)</p>

<p>I stayed for some drinks, there was cake too! And then I left the channel...</p>
