    2018-07-04 <span class="words-count">| 1738 words |</span> Information on omitted people who helped make Perl 6 better</p>
  <p>Today, I came across a reddit post from a couple months
back, from a rather irate person claiming themselves to be possibly
the only person to never receive any credit for their work on Perl 6.</p>

<p>I was aware that person committed at least one commit and knowing the
contributors list is generated automagically with a script, I thought to myself
"Well, that's clear and provable bullshit." And I went to prove it.</p>

<h2 id="moarnomore">Moar No More</h2>

<p>I looked up the commit I knew about, looked at the release announcement for
the release it went into and… that person was indeed missing! It was the
2017.02 release, which I released. So what was going on? Did I have an alter-ego
that shamelessly erased random people from the contrib list without my
having any memory of it?!</p>

<p>First, a brief intro on how the contrib script works: it uses <code>git</code> to look
up commits in checkouts of 5 repos: Rakudo, NQP, MoarVM, Docs, and Roast.
Until <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/27761645c59446090d895e50e5cd7a1ab3a93ab7#diff-508f29ffdf70323e02c5be76f4f30364">December 2016</a> the script just used the day of the
release as last release, which was later switched to using the timestamp
on the Rakudo's tag. The script gathers all the contributors from commits,
crunches the names through the names map in CREDITS files in the repos, and
it spits out the names ordered by the number of commits made, largest first.</p>

<p>I set out to figure out why a person was missing from the release announcement.
After digging through commits, CREDITS files, and tracing the code in
<a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/tools/contributors.p6">the contributor generating script</a>, I found out that in
September 2016, I <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/bd3d430210d6d8c6f601718dd4b290c3c9753206">introduced a bug</a> into the contributors script. After some refactoring I accidentally left out <a href="https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM">MoarVM repository</a>
from the list of repos the script searches, so all the contributors to the MoarVM
since September 2016 were missing! Since many of them also contribute to the
other 4 repos, it was harder to spot that something was wrong.</p>

<p>I filed the problem as <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2024">R#2024</a>
and left it at that for the time being.</p>

<h2 id="missingmore">Missing More</h2>

<p>I started working on the problem and implemented a new feature in
the contributors script that lets you look up contributors for past releases.
Neat! So let's try it out for some release before my bug was made, shall we?</p>

<p>I ran the contrib script for 2016.08 relase and then ran another script that
diffed the names from that output against what is on the release announcement.
The output was:</p>

<pre><code>Announcement has these extra names: David Warring
Contrib script has these extra names: Arne Skjærholt, Bart Wiegmans
</code></pre>

<p>The announcement had an extra name and was missing two. The way the contrib
script figures out when one release ends and another starts is iffy, especially
so in the past. There's a gap of about a day where contributors can slip
through: e.g. release manager runs the release at 2PM, someone commits at 3PM,
and that commit didn't make it into this release and will be included in the
next, or might even be missed entirely.</p>

<p>So that was one problem I noticed. Is that where the difference for 2016.08
release names list comes from? Let's try the earliest post-The-Christmas
release: 2016.01-RC1</p>

<pre><code>Announcement has these extra names: Andy Weidenbaum, Lloyd Fournier, skids
Contrib script has these extra names: A. Sinan Unur, Aleks-Daniel Jakimenko-Aleksejev,
Brad Gilbert, Brian S. Julin, Brock Wilcox, Bruce Gray, Carl Masak,
Christian Bartolomäus, Christopher Bottoms, Claudio Ramirez, Dale Evans,
Dave Olszewski, David Brunton, Fritz Zaucker, Jake Russo, James ( Jeremy )
Carman, Jeffrey Goff, Jim Davis, John Gabriele, LLFourn, Marcel Timmerman,
Martin Dørum Nygaard, Neil Shadrach, Salvador Ortiz, Shlomi Fish, Siavash
Askari Nasr, Stéphane Payrard, Sylvain Colinet, Wenzel P. P. Peppmeyer,
Zoffix Znet, fireartist, sylvarant, vinc17fr
</code></pre>

<p>That's huge! One name stood out to me in that list—and it isn't my own—it was
that same person from reddit who was complaining that they don't get credit.
They got left out twice: in 2016.01 and again in 2017.02. No wonder
they're pissed off, but I wish they would've said something in 2016.01, so
we'd've fixed the Missing Persons issues back then instead of now.</p>

<p>The 2016.02 release has a bunch of missing names as well. I can surmise
the cause of the issue is a <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/05133931a9b6b2dd48e4001889bf7dbe37d5b8a4#diff-508f29ffdf70323e02c5be76f4f30364">previously fixed</a> mis-implementation of the contributors
script where it'd be quiet if some of the repo checkouts were missing. Neither I (until
that point), nor earlier release managers had all of at the right locations
the script was expecting, so it's possible that's how some repos were missed.</p>

<p>At the time, I assumed only the docs repo was missing and <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/announce/2016.08.md">we credited missing Docs contributors</a> in the 2016.08 announcement. However, now I realize that other release managers likely had
different directory setups and thus missed different sets of people.</p>

<h2 id="thefuture">The Future</h2>

<p>Thus, we have identified four issues with the way contributor's script
is or has been generating the list of contributors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Relying on the time when the release manager runs the contributor script,
potentially creating a gap of unrecorded contributions between the time
the script is run and the time the next run of contrib script considers as "last release"</li>
<li>Relying on release manager's setup of directories/repos. Even after
a <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/05133931a9b6b2dd48e4001889bf7dbe37d5b8a4#diff-508f29ffdf70323e02c5be76f4f30364">previous fix</a> in this area, we're still relying
on the release manager to have up-to-date checkouts of repos</li>
<li>Missing contributors from entire repositories due to unnoticed bug in the code</li>
<li>What happens with commits made at the time of past release in a branch
that is merged at the time of the next release? Do they get lost?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm taking the lazy way out and leaving it to the current release managers
to resolve these problems. I filed <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2028">R#2028</a> with the list of issues and have full trust the
solution that will be implemented will be suitable :)</p>

<h2 id="thefound">The Found</h2>

<p>And now, of course, the list of previously unsung heros who made Perl 6
better in the past two and a half years, in alphabetical order. I've also
<a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ade83c861484f5f4e4184a88d9dae79a2cdf110c">added them to our past release announcements</a>.</p>

<p>It's possible this list includes the missing-found from <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/announce/2016.08.md">2016.08</a> announcement as well as people who were not logged in the CREDITS file in the past but are now,
but I figure it's better to list them twice than none at all.</p>

<p>If you still believe we're
missing someone, <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/new">let us know</a> so
the problem can be fixed.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So this was quite a fun investigation and hopefully all the missing people
have been found and this is the last missing-found persons list we compile.</p>

<p>The most important lesson, however, is: report problems as soon as you find
them. We could've fixed this at the start of 2016, and those who knew they
were left out could've saved two years of being upset about it.</p>
