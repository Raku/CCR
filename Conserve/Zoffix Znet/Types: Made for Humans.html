    2016-04-04 <span class="words-count">| 1513 words |</span> Description of Perl 6&#39;s type system and how to define your own subsets.</p>
  <p>In my first college programming course, I was taught that Pascal language
has <code>Integer</code>, <code>Boolean</code>, and <code>String</code> types among others. I learned the types
were there because computers were stupid. While dabbling in C, I learned more
about what <code>int</code>, <code>char</code>, and other vermin looked like inside the warm,
buzzing metal box under my desk.</p>

<p>Perl 5 didn't have types, and I felt free as a kid on a bike, rushing through
the wind, going down a slope. No longer did I have to cram my mind into the narrow
slits computer hardware dictated me to. I had <em>data</em> and I could do whatever I
wanted with it, as long as I didn't get the wrong kind of data. And when I did
get it, I fell off my bike and skinned my knees.</p>

<p>With Perl 6, you can have the cake and eat it too. You can use types or avoid
them. You can have broad types that accept many kinds of values or narrow ones.
And you can enjoy the speed of types that represent the mind of the machine, or
you can enjoy the precision of your own custom types that represent your mind,
the types made for humans.</p>

<h2 id="gradualtyping">Gradual Typing</h2>

<pre><code>my       $a = 'whatever';
my Str   $b = 'strings only';
my Str:D $c = 'defined strings only';
my int   $d = 16; # native int

sub foo ($x) { $x + 2 }
sub bar (Int:D $x) returns Int { $x + 2 }
</code></pre>

<p>Perl 6 has gradual typing, which means you can either use types or avoid them.
So why bother with them at all?</p>

<p>First, types restrict the range of values that can be contained in your
variable, accepted by your method or sub or returned by them.
This functions both as data validation and as a safety net for garbage data
generated by incorrect code.</p>

<p>Also, you can get better performance and reduced memory usage when using native,
machine-mind types, providing they're the appropriate tool for your data.</p>

<h2 id="built-intypes">Built-In Types</h2>

<p>There's a veritable smörgåsbord of <a href="http://docs.perl6.org/type.html">built-in types in Perl 6</a>. If the thing your subroutine does makes
sense to be done only on integers, use an <a href="http://docs.perl6.org/type/Int"><code>Int</code></a> for your
parameters.
If negatives don't make sense either, limit the range of values even further
and use a <code>UInt</code>—an unsigned <code>Int</code>. On the other hand, if you want to handle
a broader range, <a href="http://docs.perl6.org/type/Numeric"><code>Numeric</code></a> type may
be more appropriate.</p>

<p>If you want to drive closer to the metal, Perl 6 also offers a range of
native types that map into what you'd normally find with, say, <code>C</code>. Using these
may offer performance improvements or lower memory usage. The available types
are: <code>int</code>, <code>int8</code>, <code>int16</code>, <code>int32</code>, <code>int64</code>, <code>uint</code>, <code>uint8</code>, <code>uint16</code>, <code>uint32</code>, <code>uint64</code>, <code>num</code>, <code>num32</code>, and <code>num64</code>. The number in the type name
signifies the available bits, with the numberless types being
platform-dependent.</p>

<p>Sub-byte types such as <code>int1</code>, <code>int2</code>, and <code>int4</code> are planned to be implemented
in the future as well.</p>

<h2 id="smileys">Smileys</h2>

<pre><code>multi foo (Int:U $x) { 'Y U NO define $x?'         }
multi foo (Int:D $x) { "The square of $x is {$x²}" }

my Int $x;
say foo $x;
$x = 42;
say foo $x;

# OUTPUT:
# Y U NO define $x?
# The square of 42 is 1764
</code></pre>

<p>Smileys are <code>:U</code>, <code>:D</code>, or <code>:_</code> appended to the type name. The <code>:_</code> is the
default you get when you don't specify a smiley. The <code>:U</code> specifies
<code>undefined values only</code>, while <code>:D</code> specifies <code>defined values only</code>.</p>

<p>This can be useful to detect whether a method is called on the class or on the
instance by having two multies with <code>:U</code> and <code>:D</code> on the invocant. And if you
work at a nuclear powerplant, ensuring your rod insertion subroutine never
tries to insert by an undefined amount is also a fine thing, I imagine.</p>

<h2 id="subsets:tailor-madetypes">Subsets: Tailor-Made Types</h2>

<p>Built-in types are cool and all, but most of the data programmers work with
doesn't match them <strong>precisely</strong>. That's where Perl 6 subsets come into play:</p>

<pre><code>subset Prime of Int where *.is-prime;
my Prime $x = 3;
$x = 11; # works
$x = 4;  # Fails with type mismatch
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <code>subset</code> keyword, we created a type called <code>Prime</code> on the fly. It's
a subset of <code>Int</code>, so anything that's non-<code>Int</code> doesn't fit the type. We
also specify an additional restriction with the <code>where</code> keyword; that
restriction being that <code>.is-prime</code> method called on the given value must
return a true value.</p>

<p>With that single line of code, we created a special type and can use it as
if it were built-in! Not only can we use it to specify the type of variables,
sub/method parameters and return values, but we can test arbitrary values
against it with the smartmatch operator, just as we can with built-in types:</p>

<pre><code>subset Prime of Int where *.is-prime;
say "It's an Int"  if 'foo' ~~ Int;   # false, it's a Str
say "It's a prime" if 31337 ~~ Prime; # true, it's a prime number
</code></pre>

<p>Is your "type" a one-off thing you just want to apply to a single variable?
You don't need to declare a separate <code>subset</code> at all! Just use the <code>where</code>
keyword after the variable and you're good to go:</p>

<pre><code>multi is-a-prime (Int $ where *.is-prime --&gt; 'Yup' ) {}
multi is-a-prime (Any                    --&gt; 'Nope') {}

say is-a-prime 3;     # Yup
say is-a-prime 4;     # Nope
say is-a-prime 'foo'; # Nope
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--&gt;</code> in the signature above is just another way to indicate the return
type, or in this case, a concrete returned value. So we have two multies with different
signatures. First one takes an <code>Int</code> that is a prime number and the second
one takes everything else. With exactly zero code in the bodies of our multies
we wrote a subroutine that can tell you whether a number is prime!!</p>

<h2 id="packitallupforreuse">Pack it All Up for Reuse</h2>

<p>What we've learned so far is pretty sweet, but sweet ain't awesome! You may end up using some
of your custom types quite frequently. Working at a company
where product numbers can be at most 20 characters, following some format?
Perfect! Let's create a subtype just for that:</p>

<pre><code>subset ProductNumber of Str where { .chars &lt;= 20 and m/^ \d**3 &lt;[-#]&gt;/ };
my ProductNumber $num = '333-FOOBAR';
</code></pre>

<p>This is great, but we don't want to repeat this subset stuff all over the place.
Let's shove it into a separate module we can <code>use</code>.
I'll create <code>/opt/local/Perl6/Company/Types.pm6</code> because <code>/opt/local/Perl6</code>
is the path included in module search path for all the apps I write for
this fictional company. Inside this file, we'll have this code:</p>

<pre><code>unit module Company::Types;
my package EXPORT::DEFAULT {
    subset ProductNumber of Str where { .chars &lt;= 20 and m/^ \d**3 &lt;[-#]&gt;/ };
}
</code></pre>

<p>We name our module and let our shiny subsets be exported by default.
What will our code look like now? It'll look pretty sweet—no, wait, AWESOME—this
time:</p>

<pre><code>use Company::Types;
my ProductNumber $num1 = '333-FOOBAR'; # succeeds
my ProductNumber $num2 = 'meow';       # fails
</code></pre>

<p>And so, with a single <code>use</code> statement, we extended Perl 6 to provide
custom-tailored types for us that match perfectly what we want our data to be
like.</p>

<h2 id="awesomeerrormessagesforsubsets">Awesome Error Messages for Subsets</h2>

<p>If you've been actually trying out all these examples, you may have noticed
a minor flaw. The error messages you get are Less Than Awesome:</p>

<pre><code>Type check failed in assignment to $num2;
expected Company::Types::EXPORT::DEFAULT::ProductNumber but got Str ("meow")
in block &lt;unit&gt; at test.p6 line 3
</code></pre>

<p>When <em>awesome</em> is the goal, you certainly have a way to improve those messages.
Pop open our <code>Company::Types</code> file again, and extend the <code>where</code> clause
of our <code>ProductNumber</code> type to include an awesome error message:</p>

<pre><code>subset ProductNumber of Str where {
    .chars &lt;= 20 and m/^ \d**3 &lt;[-#]&gt;/
        or warn 'ProductNumber type expects a string at most 20 chars long'
            ~ ' with the first 4 characters in the format of \d\d\d[-|#]'
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now, whenever the thing doesn't match our type, the message will be included
before the <code>Type check...</code> message and the stack trace, providing more info on
what sort of stuff was expected. You can also call <code>fail</code> instead of <code>warn</code>
here, if you wish, in which case the <code>Type check...</code> message won't be printed,
giving you more control over the error the user of your code receives.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Perl 6 was made for humans to tell computers what to do, not for computers to
restrict what is possible. Using types catches programming errors and does
data validation, but you can abstain from using types when you don't want to
or when the type of data you get is uncertain.</p>

<p>You have the freedom to refine the built-in types to represent exactly the
data you're working with and you can create a
<a href="http://modules.perl6.org/dist/Subsets::Common">module for common subsets</a>.
Importing such a module lets you write code as if those custom types were
part of Perl 6 itself.</p>

<p>The Perl 6 technology lets you create types that are made for Humans.
And it's about time we started telling computers what to do.</p>
