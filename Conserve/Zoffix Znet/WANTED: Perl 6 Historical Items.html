    2018-04-16 <span class="words-count">| 437 words |</span> A call to collect memorabilia for a Perl 6 museum</p>
  <p>The Perl 6 programming language had a turbulent birth. It was announced in
the summer of 2000 and the first stable language release shipped out only 2 years
ago, on Christmas, 2015. A lot has happened during that decade and a half,
yet the details are hard to piece together.</p>

<p>After my recent facelift to <a href="https://rakudo.org/">rakudo.org</a>, I'm
working on a (second) facelift to <a href="https://perl6.org">perl6.org</a> website.</p>

<p>Part of the work involves bringing all the Perl 6 deliverables under one umbrella, so the user isn't thrown around multiple websites, trying to find what to install. At the same time, we want to strengthen the distinction between Perl 6 the language and the compilers that implement it, as well as encourage more implementors to give it a go at implementing a Perl 6 programming language compiler.</p>

<p>The Perl 6 Programming Language Museum will be part of that effort and along with interesting tidbits of Perl 6 history, it'll showcase past implementation attempts that may no longer be in active development today. Since I don't know much about what happened before I came to the language sometime in 2015, I need your help in collecting those tidbits.</p>

<p>In my mind's eye, I'm imagining a few pages on perl6.org; something in the same vein as <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/software-languages/">Computer History Museum's pages</a>â€”pictures, years, and info, and potentially links to code repositories. Depending on the content we collect, it's possible there will be a digital PDF version of the Museum that can also be printed and handed out at events, if desired.</p>

<p>I'm looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Descriptions of interesting/significant events (like the mug throwing incident).</li>
<li>Descriptions of interesting/significant implementations of Perl 6 or influential Perl 6 projects. Having links to repos/tarballs of their code is a plus.</li>
<li>Samples of interesting/significant email threads or chat logs.</li>
<li>Pictures of interesting/significant objects (first sight at plush Camelias?).</li>
<li>Pictures of interesting/significant humans (<a href="https://github.com/perl6/museum-items/blob/master/MODEL-RELEASE-FORM.md">a filled out model release form is required</a>).</li>
<li>Anything else that's Museum worthy.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any of these items, please submit them to the appropriate year directory in the <a href="https://github.com/perl6/museum-items">Perl 6 Museum Items repository</a>. If you're a member of Perl 6 GitHub org, you should already have a commit bit to that repo. Otherwise, submit your items via a pull request.</p>

<p>Let's build something cool and interesting for the people using Perl 6 a hundred years from now to look at and remember!</p>

<p>If you have any questions or need help, <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6">talk to a human on our IRC chat</a>.</p>
