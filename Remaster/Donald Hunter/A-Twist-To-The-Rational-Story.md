# A Twist To The Rational Story

*Originally published on [2 September 2018](https://donaldh.wtf/2018/09/a-twist-to-the-rational-story/) by Donald Hunter.*

As a followup to brrt's [Curious Benchmark](http://brrt-to-the-future.blogspot.com/2018/08/a-curious-benchmark.html) post, I wanted to explore some of the questions that were left unanswered.

## A Reminder

This is the benchmark that we started with.

```` raku
# reciprocal.pl
my $x = 0;
$x += 1/$_ for 1..50_000_000;
print "$x\n";
say "Took {now - BEGIN now} seconds";
````

````
18.304749238293297
Took 37.44224442 seconds
````

I ran this on a Raku with all the nice MoarVM postrelease-opts performance improvements. Even still, it takes its leisurely time to complete the 50M iterations. In the samples below I am going to use a far smaller range, for reasons that will become clear.

## Enforcing the Rat Type

Firstly, what happens if we require ~$x~ to be a ~Rat~?

```` raku
my Rat $x = 0.Rat;
$x += 1/$_ for 1..50_000;
say $x;
CATCH { default { .say } }
````

````
Type check failed in assignment to $x; expected Rat but got Num (4.437963841730785e0)
  in sub  at EVAL_0 line 4
  in block <unit> at EVAL_0 line 7
  in block <unit> at -e line 1
````

That's a surprise! Partway through execution, the `Rat` must overflow and get promoted to a `Num` – or is that demoted?

## Let's Try FatRat

Okay, so `Rat` wasn't big enough so let's try a `FatRat` instead.

```` raku
{
    my FatRat $x = 0.FatRat;
    $x += 1/$_ for 1..50_000;
    say "Took $(now - ENTER now) seconds";
    {
      say $x;
      say "Took $(now - ENTER now) seconds";
    }
}
````

There are two things to note here. Firstly, the precision of the result is far
greater. Secondly, it runs like treacle. It's taken nearly 13 min for just 50K
iterations. You're welcome to try a 500K or more, but the run time deteriorates non-linearly.

## Reducing Hyper Fun

Okay, that was interesting. And we've uncovered just how slow `Rat` and `FatRat` are just
now. But questions. What would be a more idiomatic way to write this in Raku?

```` raku
say [+] [1..50_000] »**» -1;
say "Took {now - BEGIN now} seconds";
````

````
11.397003949278504
Took 0.32804122 seconds
````

That was pretty slick. Why not run it for more iterations, I hear you ask.

```` raku
say [+] [1..500_000] »**» -1;
CATCH { default { .say } }
````

````
Too many arguments in flattening array.
  in sub  at EVAL_0 line 3
  in block <unit> at EVAL_0 line 5
  in block <unit> at -e line 1
````

Sadface. I'm not sure why this flattens before the reduce operator.

## It's a Race

Could we speed things up a bit with a `.race`? Yes we can!

```` raku
say [+] [1..50_000].race.map(1 / *);
say "Took {now - BEGIN now} seconds";
````

````
11.397003949278504
Took 0.2375065 seconds
````
