YAPC::Europe::2008 was awesome, as YAPC::Europe does tend to be. I think my talks went fairly well, though attempting to sleep more and drink less than usual was epic fail, so I'm currently exhausted and enjoying a quiet, relaxing night in the hotel room. It was also great to meet up with *Patrick Michaud*, who I work with a lot on Rakudo, but I hadn't seen for over a year, and to be able to hack with him as well as other Parrot and Rakudo folks during and around the conference. So, a huge thanks to the organizers, and to everyone who came along and made it such a good time.
