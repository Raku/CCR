I'm now back from my vacation, which involved backpacking across Russia and then some time in Belarus. It was great to spend plenty of time outdoors, see lots of new places and take some time away from coding. And now I'm refreshed and ready to dig back into Rakudo development, which I will do in the coming days. :-)

In other news, I will be attending the London Perl Workshop (got flight booked last night). Missed it last year, so looking forward to being there again. Missed the talk submissions deadline though (was vacationing), so just coming to listen, see friends and enjoy some good English ale.
