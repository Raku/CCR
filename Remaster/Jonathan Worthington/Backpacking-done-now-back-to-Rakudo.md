# Backpacking done, now back to Rakudo

I'm just back from my yearly autumn backpacking trip, and once again I took in a few Perl things amongst my vacation. I attended YAPC::Asia for the first time, and gave a couple of talks; you may be interested to see [the slides](http://www.jnthn.net/articles.shtml). I think they were both quite well received, though one of them had a couple of bugs. I muchly enjoyed staying with the Pauleys - thanks for the hospitality...and introducing me to tonkatsu!

Other than Japan, I also visited South Korea. I gave a talk at Seoul.pm, and many of the Perl mongers there were kind enough to take time out to show me around and have dinner and beers with me, which was really great. As well as great Korean hospitality, I can't not mention that Korean food is SO good - I'm missing it lots already.

So, it was a great time (thanks to everyone who made it so - too many to mention here), and now I'm back, re-energized and ready to dig back into hacking on Rakudo. In fact, this is my last real vacation before Rakudo *, so I made the most of it. The next few months are going to be a serious amount of work - but never fear, I'm hacking on it already. :-)

My signatures Hague Grant got approved. I've started on that already, and I'll try and blog some progress in the next few days (for now I've done nothing more exciting than some refactors in preparation for the changes that will really make a difference...but with my current uncommitted bits they seem to shave roughly 10% off Rakudo startup time anyway, and that's before I begin the changes I expect to make more of a difference.) Also, during a Rakudo day before my trip and some hacking at YAPC::Asia, `Blizkost` made some more progress. I'll blog about that soon too. :-)

OK, back to hunting down bugs in my latest changes...
