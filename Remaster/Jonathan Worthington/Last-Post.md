Well, on use-perl.github.io, anyway. I'd like to thank those who run this place for doing so, as it's been the place I've blogged about my Raku stuff for the last couple of years. However, I've found the user experience of WordPress a lot more enjoyable - it was great for the Raku Advent Calendar - and figure I'll blog more if I more enjoy doing so.

So, from now you'll be able to read my Rakudo news and other Raku related ramblings from my [shiny new blog](http://6guts.wordpress.com/). For those reading through Planet Six, no action required - I'll arrange for my new blog to be aggregated there.

See you [over there](http://6guts.wordpress.com/).
