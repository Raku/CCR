# One month, three conferences!

I've stayed in the same country for a whole month now, and am feeling restless. Thankfully, the Perl community has provided a fix for this problem. In fact, it's provided three of them: I'll be attending (and speaking at) the German Perl Workshop, the Ukrainian Perl Workshop and the Dutch Perl Workshop. So if you're going to any of these, looking forward to seeing you there! :-)
