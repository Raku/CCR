I've been working on a Raku FAQ for [Programmer's Heaven](http://www.programmersheaven.com/), where I work. Today it has [published](http://www.programmersheaven.com/2/Perl6-FAQ) and at the moment it answers over 100 questions; I'll be adding more in the future. There is also a step-by-step guide to [writing your first Raku program](http://www.programmersheaven.com/2/Perl6-QuickStart). Hope this is helpful, and comments, corrections and suggestions will be very welcome!
