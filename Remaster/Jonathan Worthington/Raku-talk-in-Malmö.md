Recently I moved to Sweden to join startup company [Edument](http://www.edument.se/). They are, happily, very open to and supportive of my involvement in the Raku project, and are organizing and sponsoring me to give a [talk on Perl - both 5 and 6](http://natverk.dfs.se/node/19602) for the [Dataföreningen](http://www.dfs.se/) in Malmö on Tuesday 27th April. I believe this is only open to those who are members of the user group; if you are, feel free to come along though.
