# Taking a short break

Just a little update. When I [last posted here](https://6guts.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/last-week-smaller-hashes-faster-startup-and-many-fixes/), I expected to write the post about what I got up to in the second week of May within a couple of days. Unfortunately, in that next couple of days I got quite sick, then after a few days a little better again, then – most likely due to my reluctance to cancel anything – promptly got sick again. This time, I’ve been trying to make a better job of resting so I can make a more complete recovery.

By now I’m into another round of “getting better”, which is good. However, I’m taking it as easy as I can these days; at the weekend I will have my wedding, and – as it’s something I fully intend to only do once in my life – I would like to be in as good health as possible so I can enjoy the day! :-)

Thanks for understanding, and I hope to be back in Raku action around the middle of next week.
