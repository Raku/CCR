Today, [The Toronto Perl Mongers](http://to.pm.org/) graciously let me present a short lightning talk titled *Raku: What Programming In The Future Is Like?*


The slides for the talk are available at [http://tpm2016-2.zoffix.com/](http://tpm2016-2.zoffix.com/) and [the video for it is available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/pWuxwurtALc?t=49m32s). The link starts at my talk, but be sure to watch the whole thing, as there were many other interesting lightning talks at the event.

Enjoy!
