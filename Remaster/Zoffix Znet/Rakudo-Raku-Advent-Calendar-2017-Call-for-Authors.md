# Rakudo Raku Advent Calendar 2017 Call for Authors
    
*Originally published on [24 October 2017](https://perl6.party//post/Rakudo-Perl-6-Advent-Calendar-2017--Call-for-Authors) by Zoffix Znet.*

Every year since 2009, the Rakudo Raku community publishes a Rakudo Raku advent calendar, in the form of blog posts on [https://raku-advent.blog](https://raku-advent.blog).

To keep up this great tradition, we need 24 blog posts, and volunteers who write them. If you want to contribute a blog post about anything related to Rakudo Raku, please add your name (and potentially also a topic already) to [the schedule](https://github.com/raku/mu/blob/master/misc/rakuadvent-2017/schedule), and if you don't yet have a login on [the advent blog](https://rakuadvent.wordpress.com), please tell [Zoffix](https://twitter.com/zoffix/) or someone on [#raku IRC chat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#raku) your email address so that they can send you an invitation.

Rakudo Raku advent blog posts should be finished the day before they are due, and published with midnight (UTC) of the due date as publishing date.

If you have any questions, or want to discuss blog post ideas, please join on the [#raku IRC channel on irc.freenode.org](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#raku).
